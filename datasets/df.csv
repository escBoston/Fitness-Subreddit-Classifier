Been struggling with my weight, physical capabilities and image for nearly a decade and finally got over the consistency hump and have been thrilled with my latest progress.

Strength stats (Squat / Deadlift / Bench in lbs):

Start:  165 / 245 / 145 

Current:  315 / 375 / 235

**Phase 1 - Raw weight loss and learning my limits, first 3 months (April 2019 through end of June 2019)**

* Diet:  I focused on portion and calorie control.  I targeted 1800 calories (a 500 calories deficit from TDEE) and a 35/35/30 protein/fat/carb macro split.  I wanted to get carbs under control while still maintaining enough energy to exercise.  The deficit was rough to begin with but I wanted to be aggressive in trimming down my body fat.
* Exercise:  
   * First 3 weeks:  Nothing revolutionary here.  30 minutes of elliptical, medium resistance, focused on keeping my HR above 160.  I would follow up with 3 sets of push ups (10-12 reps) and 3 sets of air squats (20 reps)
   * Remainder of Phase 1:  I went with a 4 day bro split with most exercises in the RPE 6-7 range.
      * Monday: Chest and Triceps:  Dumbbell Bench 3x10, Skullcrushers 3x12, Incline Benchpress 3x8, Cable Tricep Pushdown 4x15, Cable Chest Fly 3x15.  Wanted to stick to basics here and create a good foundation around my very tender left shoulder (which would haunt me for the next 6 months until I was diagnosed with mild thoracic outlet syndrome).
      * Tuesday:  Legs:  Back Squat 5x5, RDLs 3 x10, Leg Extensions 4 x10 superset with Seated Leg Curls 4x10, Calf Raises 3x20.  I knew my bench would be my weakest mainlift based on my previous failures of working out consistently but I was not prepared for how terrible my back squat would feel. I did grind through 5x5 to build strength which I was moderately successful but my set up was always random until later in my progression.
      * Wednesday:  Rest
      * Thursday:  Back and Biceps:  Conventional Deadlifts 3x5, Cable or Landmine Rows 3x8, Lat Pulldowns 4x10, Dumbbell Bicep Curls 3x12, EZ Bar Preacher 3x8, Dumbbel Hammer Curls 3x10.  Deadlifts felt too good early on,  pulled my back about 6 weeks in and had to rehab with a chiropractor for 6 weeks after that.  I was able to still lift lightly around the tenderness but hated I let my ego control the weight instead of logic.  My biceps and lats were also grossly underdeveloped.  My biceps weren't a huge focus but I knew I needed stronger lats to progress.  I was majorly intimidated by pull ups and chin ups and avoided them for FAR too long because of my weight and left shoulder. I'll address this more in Phase 2.
      * Friday: Shoulders:  Dumbdell Shoulder Press 3x8, Arnold Presses 3x10, Seated Face Pulls 4x12, Rear Delt Flys 3x12, Cable Lateral Raises 4x15.  I was FAR too aggressive early in this phase.  I cannot stress to new lifters how crucial shoulder health is to making strength progress.  Not until my final month of Phase 1 did drop most of my weights so I could complete my full rep ranges.  Cable lateral raises to this day I do still find incredibly valuable both functionally and aesthetically.
      * Saturday: Rest
      * Sunday:  Active Recovery:  This would include anything from a 30 min swim to 20 min max incline walking on treadmills to 30 min sprint on the elliptical.  I was often very very sore still and wanted to create some healthy blood flow without completely taxing my body.
* Ending Phase 1 Stats:
   * Weight: 245 lbs
   * Squat / Deadlift / Bench:  205 / 285 / 170
* Overall reflection on Phase 1:  What I felt I did well:  Diet - I cut out booze and most processed foods, my bloating was erased and my skin health was like a 180 from the past 5 years of my life.  My energy levels were also much more consistent.  What I didn't do well with:  ego lifting and learning form before adding weight - I wish I had spent more time watching and learning proper form and movements.  I felt I left a lot of growth on the table but that's part of learning.

**Phase 2: New gym, PPL and proper recovery (July 2019 to Jan 2020/Present)**

* Diet:  My biggest contrast to my phase dieting was staying in smaller caloric deficit (I eat around 2200 calories now) and increasing protein intake to match the 6 day PPL split I was about to undertake.  My macros were (and still are) closer to 43/30/27 protein/fat/carbs.  My split is pretty damn demanding on my body and I knew going into a 6 day split that without inter-week rest days, I was going to need a surplus of protein to recover properly.  I focused on baked chicken, haddock, salmon, whey protein and occasionally pork as my main sources.  I target around 220g a day.
* Exercise:
   * My programming is loosely based off Jeff Nippard's Push, Pull, Legs Hypertrophy Program.  I find Jeff to be calm, researched and delivers great content to follow along with.  My primary focus in this phase was walking a line between powerlifting and bodybuilding - so as you will see my major deviation from his program was sticking closer to a 5x5 split on my compound lifts.  I also ran this program as Legs, Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Rest.  I also moved to a new gym with a lot of experienced but friendly lifters that have helped me tremendously.  Don't be scared to ask - 99% of people are willing to help you.
   * As an overarching theme to my split, my first three days of the split are focused on strength (65 to 85% 1RM) and my second three days are focused on speed and form (45 to 65% 1RM)
   * Legs - Monday, Strength Day &amp; Thursday, Speed Day
      * Back Squat:  Alternating between 60% 5x5 and 80% 5x3 week to week.  After a lot of research, mobility work in my hips and help from folks in the gym, my set up and execution of my back squat really progressed (esp in the last 2-2.5 months).  Back squats are my favorite movement with deadlifts being a close 2nd.
      * Conventional Deadlifts:  On 5x5 squat weeks, I will deadlift for 3x8 at 50%.  On 5x3 squat weeks, I move deadlifts to my first movement on pull days at 4x4 at 75-85%.  Coupled with back squats - these two movements hit anything and everything legs.
      * Bulgarian Split Squats &amp; Raised Heel Air Squats:  Body weight only 3x10 sets on each movement, super set.  By now, my hips and CNS are pretty worn so I focus clean, clean form with these two movements.  These both helped isolate my stabilizers for keeping the descent of my squat in control.  Raised heel = 15 lb bumper plate under your heels and your toes pointed out roughly 30 degrees.
      * Leg Extensions / Lying Leg Curls / Seated Calf Raises:   Core accessory lifts for aesthetics and strength.  I would do a giant super set with all three movements, 3x12 for each.
      * Speed Day Modifications:  I add a 3x10 of safety squat bar good mornings as they help my squat and deadlift out of hole strength a TON.  I also replace lying leg curls with 3x10 Rogue reverse hyper extensions.
   * Push: Tuesday, Strength Day &amp; Friday, Speed Day
      * Benchpress w/ Football Bar:  4x6 or 5x3, alternating week to week.  This bar worked wonders for me while I was remedying my thoracic outlet issues.  It allowed me to progressively overload without creating tons of stress on my left elbow and shoulders.  It also did a great job of creating a natural bar path for when I actually do barbell bench.
      * Starting Strength Lying Tricep Extensions: 4x10, Mark Rippetoe's version of this movement is insanely good for upper chest and tricep development.  One of my favorites I discovered 1/2 way through Phase 2 and what a difference maker it has been.
      * High Incline Shoulder/Chest Press:  3x8, I place the bench around 60 degrees and keep the dumbbells parallel to each other.  Took me a long while to overload these but once my shoulder felt 100% - I have been able to increase 5 lbs/every other week for the last 12 weeks.  Highly encouraging.
      * Dips:  3 sets to failure.  Still working on improving these but they seem to translate well to my bench form.
      * Double Rope Cable Tricep Pull? Downs:  4x10, a John Meadows movement, take a quick search on Youtube for his technique here.  Nothing better for a tricep pump.  
      * Cable Ez Curl Bar Reverse Grip Push Downs: 4x12, Long name but great way to hit a different angle (especially with the reverse grip) on your triceps.
      * Cable Flys:  1 Massive Drop Set (Usually around 40-50 reps),  I will start with a weight that I can complete 10 reps for, drop to a weight I can complete another 10, etc.
      * Speed Day Modifications:  I replace high incline shoulder presses with lighter 30 degrees 3x12 incline dumbbell press.  I also do not do dips on speed days.
   * Pull:  Wednesday, Strength Day &amp; Saturday, Speed Day
      * Deadlifts:  As stated in the leg portion, these ended on either pull day or leg day.  When they end up on pull day, I like 4 sets of heavy triples.  I find my 5th set is generally very diminished.
      * Pull Ups &amp; Chin Ups (alternate set to set):  4x10,  I am still using a blue band here so I can truly focus of slow descents and precise control.  Only got confidence to start doing these 6 weeks ago but they have already reshaped my back and lats.
      * Hammersmith Low Row:  3x8, alternating reps per arm.  Really enjoy these over bent over dumbbell rows.  Far more isolated.
      * Lat Pulldown/Hammersmith High Row:  3x10,  good plain ol' lat pulldowns I feel should be in any body building or power lifting regimen.
      * Barbell Curls: 3x8,  I focus on keeping my shoulders locked and down, no shrugging.
      * Incline Lying Barbell Drag Curls:  3x12, Superset with curls.  I use the same weight from barbell curls, lay chest down on an incline bench and focus on squeezing my hands pulling with my elbows.  Has really helped create mass in my biceps.
      * Speed Day Modifications:  I add Cable Rows with fat grip individual handles, 3x15 - awesome for grip and forearm strength too.  I also add a random forearm exercise to help round out my arms.
   * Sunday: Recovery
      * Yoga, Yoga, Yoga:  I don't do anything fancy but very simple movements I find on the DoYogaWithMe Youtube Channel.  Absolutely critical for keeping my mobility high and form aligned.

My next steps are to cut down to 190 by April 1st for my full ""1 year transformation"" and hopefully get myself a set of abs for the first time in my adult life.  From there, my focus for the remainder of the year is on maintaining my physique and gaining strength.  I would like a 1000 lb total by September of this year.

**Me**

* **Weight**: 175 lbs / \~79 kg
* **Starting Weight with lifting:** 200 lbs / 91 kg
* **Starting Weight with Keto:** 255 lbs / 116 kg
* **Goal Weight**: Whatever I end up looking best at. If I look good at 150/68, I'll stop there, if not, I'll go down.
* **Height**: 5'5"" / 165.1 cm
* **Age**: 21

**Ketogains** \- (**I unfortunately use the smith machine for most work outs, starting bar weight 20lbs /9 kg.** I did not realize when starting that it was no good to use, and now just really don't know how to transition without losing progress.)

**3x a week, alternating:**

Workout A

* (Smith Machine) **Squat 5x5** \- 390 lbs / 177 kg
* (Smith) **Bench** **Press 5x5** \- 180 lbs / 82 kg
* **Single-Arm Dumbell Row, bench 5x8** \- 80 lbs / 36 kg
* **Dumbbell Shrugs 3x15** \- 65 lbs / 30 kg
* **Tricep Overhead Extension 3x8-10** \- 65 lbs / 30 kg
* (Just added weeks ago) **Lat Pull-down Machine 3x15** \- 70 lbs / 32 kg
* (Just added Weeks ago) **Assisted Pull-up Machine 3x12-15** \- 140 lbs / 64 kg

Workout B

* (Smith) **Overhead Press 3x5** \- 85 lbs / 39 kg
* (Smith) **Close-grip Bench Press 3x8** \- 175 lbs / 79 kg
* **(JUST added** on October 4, 2019.) **Deadlift** 3x4-6 - 200 lbs / 91 kg   (Keep wanting to increase deadlift reps but grip strength isn't there. I keep failing.)
* **Single-Arm Dumbell Row, bench 3x8** \- 75 lbs / 34 kg

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Info**

* &lt; 20 carbs,  75 grams of protein needed daily
* 1100 cals a day for me to lose weight, but have definitely been eating over a lot the past year. 1100-1700.
* Intermittent fasting, fasting from 2 AM - 5 PM
* Eat meats (chicken, fish, red meat) and leafy green veggies for dinner. 
* Protein powder and electrolyte supplement 
* Night snack junk; keto snacks / desserts. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Like I said, I definitely have a lot of body fat to lose,** and I know that will play a lot into the fact that I feel bulky -- especially in my shoulder area and my arms. Loose skin as well. However, even with that, I still feel as if I need to add more accessories and maybe increase the days I'm in the gym. I go MWF, but if it would be beneficial to dedicate days to accessories, I would consider doing more if they can't be added to MWF. I'd prefer only 3 days though. I just feel that my body is a bit unbalanced from this workout plan and that, as a female, I don't really want my shoulders to look too wide in comparison to everything else.

I made an album of pictures to show you guys what I look like (One slightly **NSFW**? No nudity, only stomach and covered chest).

 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/SfeIhTF)

The towel pictures are probably the best example of what I mean. Again, I know a lot of it is fat. But if this strength-based plan should be altered to help achieve the look I want, I'd love some suggestions. My back especially needs work, and I don't know where to start with additional accessories.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Info**

* &lt; 20 carbs,  75 grams of protein needed daily
* 1100 cals a day for me to lose weight, but have definitely been eating over a lot the past year. 1100-1700.
* Intermittent fasting, fasting from 2 AM - 5 PM
* Eat meats (chicken, fish, red meat) and leafy green veggies for dinner. 
* Protein powder and electrolyte supplement 
* Night snack junk; keto snacks / desserts. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Like I said, I definitely have a lot of body fat to lose,** and I know that will play a lot into the fact that I feel bulky -- especially in my shoulder area and my arms. Loose skin as well. However, even with that, I still feel as if I need to add more accessories and maybe increase the days I'm in the gym. I go MWF, but if it would be beneficial to dedicate days to accessories, I would consider doing more if they can't be added to MWF. I'd prefer only 3 days though. I just feel that my body is a bit unbalanced from this workout plan and that, as a female, I don't really want my shoulders to look too wide in comparison to everything else.

I made an album of pictures to show you guys what I look like (One slightly **NSFW**? No nudity, only stomach and covered chest).

 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/SfeIhTF)

The towel pictures are probably the best example of what I mean. Again, I know a lot of it is fat. But if this strength-based plan should be altered to help achieve the look I want, I'd love some suggestions. My back especially needs work, and I don't know where to start with additional accessories. 

**My main goal over anything is to still lose weight.**"

&amp;#x200B;

I started my first ever bulk in October after hitting the gym for 4 years and going from roughly 195lbs (45S 45B and 65D @ 16 years old in 2015) to 145lbs (265S 155B and 315D @ 19 years old in 2019).

&amp;#x200B;

This was the newbie gains I linearly progressed to whilst losing weight, obviously at the start the progression was quick but I became more obsessed with becoming skinny before I started my bulk hence why I hit the gym so long. I reached the 1rms at 17 which stayed constant until 19. So pretty much zero strength gains or muscle gains but still lost another 20lbs. It fluctuated, life happens and I wasn't the most consistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

However this is what my lifts were before starting my bulk in October, here is a video of me in September getting 1 rep on a 265lb squat.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my bulk in October and began squatting twice a week which consisted of a heavy leg session with rep ranges between 2-5 and then doing a variation of either pin squats or front squats on my second day of the week. I also have been hitting abs about 4x per week, because I want abs but also because it has significantly helped me with my mind-muscle connection when it comes to understanding how to properly breathe and brace. I attribute this to increasing my squat.

&amp;#x200B;

However the main factor throughout this bulk that has helped me with squatting is confidence under the bar. Envisioning the lift before actually squatting has helped me tremendously and not being put off when having a heavy load on your back.

&amp;#x200B;

That takes us to now. I weighed in this morning at 170lbs (pretty heavy for 4 months but considering I went from 1200kcals per day, no creatine, most likely malnourished lol to roughly 2300-2500 to bulk and using creatine which obviously adds to water weight via water retention).

&amp;#x200B;

And my stats are as follows. 170 lbs @ 20 years old 400S 230B 440D.

&amp;#x200B;

The squat 1rm is an estimation, i've only ever hit 375x2 in the gym but my estimated 1rm is 400.

Some misconceptions from the posts here ..

1) No..u DO NOT start losing testosterone after 30 overnight. If you have doubts, please see a doc and get blood labs done but don't be reading that bruh science web article claiming over 30 means your dick will go numb. I'm 45 yrs and just had mine done last month and I'm way above the range for people my age.

2) To lose FAT , it's CICO (all the trendy diets basically have one thing in common..they restrict certain foods, timing, etc to help facilitate a calorie reduction).

3) I HIGHLY recommend NOT to jump on a trendy diet as while these work short term, nobody eats bacon and steak and eggs for the next 40 years of their lives daily. You can easily do a 1800-calorie meal consisting of eggs, oats, sweet potatoes, brown rice and meat and spread these out and you'll be full and have plenty of gas in your tank in the gym.

4) To lose weight or bulk, use any online 'maintenance calorie' calculator which gives you a rough idea of how much calories u need for maintenance. For cutting, subtract 300-500 calories depending on how aggressive you wanna be and build the macros with high protein/fat and med/low carbs.

5) Carb timing is very important if you are lifting weights and want some muscle growth. It's protein that's the building block of muscle and carbs to transport the protein to the cells. 

6) Other than whey protein (mainly for convenience), creatine (proven by science) and black coffee, YOU DO NOT NEED any other supplements or pre workouts. Fish oil is up in the air.

7) Only goto the gym if u have a proven workout plan in mind and can stick to it. If not, don't bother wasting your time and energy as you won't get any results and only fail. 

8) Consistency is the key. No one got fat overnight and losing weight/getting lean typically for most people will take at least 90 days before any mirror change will happen.

9) Do NOT diet. Change your eating lifestyle ..you don't have to hungry if you are planning and eating the right foods.

I got a concussion in May of last year. Working out (and Judo) was a big part of who I am and I haven't been able to do either. I've been very, very hesitant to return to working out, because

1) I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone about what I should or shouldn't do. 

2) I'm not certain I know when I'm hurting my brain. 

I get mild headaches every day, just from life things like stress and noise. What am I supposed to do about those? They don't even go away with ibuproven. And sometimes I think that working out can mask the headaches too, the feeling of getting a good workout can mask a headache. So it seems like no one can tell me what's good for me, and I myself don't even know what's good for me. 

I'm drinking a lot of water and taking B-2 and Magnesium every day. One thing is for certain though, two weeks ago I went back to Judo and did a few rolls on the mat and people told me that my pupils looked swollen and I felt foggy. My doctor (who cleared me for Judo) told me it was psychosomatic - aka, it was all in my head! Thanks doc! He's supposed to be a concussion expert!

I ask reg at the gym to spot me. 

When I failed the rep, I was at the point of trying to push it up midway but was stagnant. 

My spotter reach down as if to grab the bar and he did everything but grab it. I.e, he literally had his hands around the bar without touching it and then stopped there and just looked at me. 

I had a ""wtf"" moment and just did what I could to force the bar up instead of allow failure, which lead to improper technique and shoulder injury. 

As per title, I take 100% responsibility, but was this bad spotting?

More importantly, where do I go from here in terms of bang for buck recovery? Is there exercises I can do for myself at home or should I consult a physio?

The injury was 2-3 months ago and has slowly gotten better since then, but not at a rate I'm satisfied by."

A year and a half ago about mid 2018 i applied for the army (New Zealand Military) and shortly after i had to do a fitness test consisting of push ups, curl ups, and a MSFT also called the beep test i failed the beep test (the running part of the test) so i started to actually run and a couple months later i passed the test.

So since mid 2018 to mid 2019 i had been running which typically consisted of 1-2 mild intensity jog a week (solo training around where i lived) and once a week a running program the military did for which was about a 45min run/jog fairly high intensity for the duration of that year.

mid 2019 i had received a injury to my hip which was a small tear to my hip labrum ( didn't find out what my injury was exactly until a month and a half later) essentially i did very little to no running from  july 2019 unit mid October 2019 ( i started physiotherapy half way through the time). since than i have been able to run normally with no limitation accept obviously my running ability.

Since mid October up until now i have been running 3 times a week at a fairly high intensity which consisting of Monday being a 1m Run 1m Jog interval run for about 10 sets (20mins), Wednesday consisting of a 1m Run 2min Jog for about 10 sets (30mins) and Friday being a 40min Jog.

Due to my injury i was unable to get into the army and had to wait longer to get into basic training  because of that I had to redo some of the application phase stuff which one of things that i had to do was the fitness test again (which i did a few days ago) and i failed the running part of the test. currently i feel pretty shit about the whole thing and feel like I've back pedaled hard and feel like the running i have done over the last few months and even the running that i had been doing months before for that year have been for nothing and I'm currently feeling like a bit of a failure right now and I'm not sure if i need to just keep it up and ill get there or am i just not meant to be a runner.",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7650173,public,,self,,,Questioning my running progress,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ew23oh/questioning_my_running_progress/,all_ads,6.0,"Questioning my running progress I'm a 19 y/o M and here's a brief sum up of my running/fitness history I've always been active throughout my adolescence but have not done much running related sports.

This is my first post on this sub, so I hope it's up to standard.

In 2017, I weighed 160 kg (352 lbs) at age 18. I know how much obesity sucks, and how miserable life can be with it. I really sympathize with other people currently struggling with it, so I'd like to help anyone in need by offering my advice on how to completely kick obesity in the balls and live your life.

*Please note - I am not a medical professional or fitness expert. This is just the stuff that worked for me personally and I'm currently happy and healthy.*

**Hard Steps**

1. **Swallow your pride.** Admit you have problems and open yourself to changes. A gym is a safe place to exercise, nobody will judge you. Take weight loss off the pedestal, anyone can do it and it's actually not that hard.
2. **Stick to the fundamentals.** Fad diets don't work for me. They all seem unsustainable and you hear a different thing in the news every second day, so who knows if any of it works? Stick to the fundamental philosophy of calories in vs calories out.
3. **Kickstart yourself.** Starting off is the hardest part of the whole thing. I required a catalyst to propel me into weight loss. I was inspired by the doco ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" to undergo a 10-day juice diet (to my understanding, this diet is not hazardous but do your own research). I lost 8kgs (17.6 lbs). This was unfathomable to me, and I was so reluctant to lose that progress, I changed a lot of my habits in order to carry that momentum forward.
4. **Start exercising weekly** (3 times a week ideally). A gym is essential for a well-rounded workout and to meet people who can support you. You can spend hours at the gym and achieve nothing if you don't know what you're doing. Find someone to show you proper exercise form and weigh in with them at the same time every week. Ideally a personal trainer. But a good gym buddy works too.
5. **Download the free app MyFitnesspall**, it is magic. It can be a pain for a week or two but after you save all your regular meals its very easy to use. It does all the work for you regarding calorie counting. Do what it says and you will lose weight, guaranteed. I have mine set to lose 1 kg a week. When you're heavy enough, that's easy.
6. **Find food hacks.** After discovering sardines on toast as a magical hangover cure, I also thought it would make great weight-loss food. White Fish is a beautiful lean protein packed with nutrients, its perfect as a staple food during your transformation. Find a similar substitute if you're not keen on fish, but Fish on toast and coffee is GOAT breakfast. Also, pickles have no calories and are awesome as a snack. Frozen blueberries also make a delicious low cal treat :)
7. **Live your life.** Nothing is worse than living a life of rigid discipline with no treats. Eat chocolate, have a few drinks with your mates on the weekend. Healthy weight loss isn't about going carb-free or following some annoying unsustainable fad diet. It's about sensible choices and moderation. No reason to give up the things you love. If you ground yourself in the above steps, this comes easily.

**Soft Steps/advice**

""Changing your lifestyle"" is something you probably hear a lot about. While that is ultimately what you will achieve, ""changing your lifestyle"" is probably the most offputting sequence of words ever invented. Change is intrinsically scary to a lot of people. Nobody wants to wake up one day and change how they live their lives. Trying to do that is impractical and doomed to fail. Instead, the key is to adapt your activities gradually. You will fall in love with the progress you've made on yourself and make the changes without even thinking about it. The shift is organic, happy and permanent.

The first step is admitting you have a problem. I know, it sounds like something out of alcoholics anonymous, but the first steps in permanent weight loss come from your mind, not your body. We each have our stories, but at the end of the day, you need to swallow your pride. Admit to yourself and to the world that you are unhealthy and are trying to change.

Don't worry about the way you look when exercising. Gyms can seem intimidating at first, you might be scared and embarrassed about what people will think. In reality, pretty much everyone at that gym supports your endeavor. And anyone who doesn't is pathetic and has no business being there. My local YMCA is one of the most supportive environments I've ever experienced. Just get in there, and do your thing.

You might hear things like ""70% of weight loss is diet and exercise isn't even important"". I can't stress how important exercise is. Not just for maintaining muscle mass, burning calories and sustaining healthy ketosis, but for the forging of discipline and self-confidence. Personally, my self-confidence was zilch when I started. I saw myself as wet noodle not capable of doing anything. But trust me, you will feel like a warrior with an unbreakable will of iron after a while.

You will need help. I'm not sure what kind of animal can lose as much weight as me without help, but they are legendary. Having someone to weigh in with regularly is imperative. It kind of forces you to make progress and to not back out of your commitments so easily. I am fortunate enough to have a personal trainer, but I understand that not everyone can afford one. In that case, my advice is to get a buddy who really cares about you to help you.

Make sure your exercise form is on point. You might think you're a legend on the seated-row machine, but you might well be doing it wrong and looking like a boob. If you are new to working out and don't have a trainer, ask for advice on proper form from people around you. Those big muscly guys usually love to help, I promise.

In 2017, I weighed 160 kg (352 lbs) at age 18. I know how much obesity sucks, and how miserable life can be with it. I really sympathize with other people currently struggling with it, so I'd like to help anyone in need by offering my advice on how to completely kick obesity in the balls and live your life.

*Please note - I am not a medical professional or fitness expert. This is just the stuff that worked for me personally and I'm currently happy and healthy.*

**Hard Steps**

1. **Swallow your pride.** Admit you have problems and open yourself to changes. A gym is a safe place to exercise, nobody will judge you. Take weight loss off the pedestal, anyone can do it and it's actually not that hard. 
2. **Stick to the fundamentals.** Fad diets don't work for me. They all seem unsustainable and you hear a different thing in the news every second day, so who knows if any of it works? Stick to the fundamental philosophy of calories in vs calories out.
3. **Kickstart yourself.** Starting off is the hardest part of the whole thing. I required a catalyst to propel me into weight loss. I was inspired by the doco ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" to undergo a 10-day juice diet (to my understanding, this diet is not hazardous but do your own research). I lost 8kgs (17.6 lbs). This was unfathomable to me, and I was so reluctant to lose that progress, I changed a lot of my habits in order to carry that momentum forward.
4. **Start exercising weekly** (3 times a week ideally). A gym is essential for a well-rounded workout and to meet people who can support you. You can spend hours at the gym and achieve nothing if you don't know what you're doing. Find someone to show you proper exercise form and weigh in with them at the same time every week. Ideally a personal trainer. But a good gym buddy works too.
5.  **Download the free app MyFitnesspall**, it is magic. It can be a pain for a week or two but after you save all your regular meals its very easy to use. It does all the work for you regarding calorie counting. Do what it says and you will lose weight, guaranteed. I have mine set to lose 1 kg a week. When you're heavy enough, that's easy.
6. **Find food hacks.** After discovering sardines on toast as a magical hangover cure, I also thought it would make great weight-loss food. White Fish is a beautiful lean protein packed with nutrients, its perfect as a staple food during your transformation. Find a similar substitute if you're not keen on fish, but Fish on toast and coffee is GOAT breakfast. Also, pickles have no calories and are awesome as a snack. Frozen blueberries also make a delicious low cal treat :)
7. **Live your life.** Nothing is worse than living a life of rigid discipline with no treats. Eat chocolate, have a few drinks with your mates on the weekend. Healthy weight loss isn't about going carb-free or following some annoying unsustainable fad diet. It's about sensible choices and moderation. No reason to give up the things you love. If you ground yourself in the above steps, this comes easily.

**Soft Steps/advice**

""Changing your lifestyle"" is something you probably hear a lot about. While that is ultimately what you will achieve, ""changing your lifestyle"" is probably the most offputting sequence of words ever invented. Change is intrinsically scary to a lot of people. Nobody wants to wake up one day and change how they live their lives. Trying to do that is impractical and doomed to fail. Instead, the key is to adapt your activities gradually. You will fall in love with the progress you've made on yourself and make the changes without even thinking about it. The shift is organic, happy and permanent. 

The first step is admitting you have a problem. I know, it sounds like something out of alcoholics anonymous, but the first steps in permanent weight loss come from your mind, not your body. We each have our stories, but at the end of the day, you need to swallow your pride. Admit to yourself and to the world that you are unhealthy and are trying to change.

Don't worry about the way you look when exercising. Gyms can seem intimidating at first, you might be scared and embarrassed about what people will think. In reality, pretty much everyone at that gym supports your endeavor. And anyone who doesn't is pathetic and has no business being there. My local YMCA is one of the most supportive environments I've ever experienced. Just get in there, and do your thing.

You might hear things like ""70% of weight loss is diet and exercise isn't even important"". I can't stress how important exercise is. Not just for maintaining muscle mass, burning calories and sustaining healthy ketosis, but for the forging of discipline and self-confidence. Personally, my self-confidence was zilch when I started. I saw myself as wet noodle not capable of doing anything. But trust me, you will feel like a warrior with an unbreakable will of iron after a while.

You will need help. I'm not sure what kind of animal can lose as much weight as me without help, but they are legendary. Having someone to weigh in with regularly is imperative. It kind of forces you to make progress and to not back out of your commitments so easily. I am fortunate enough to have a personal trainer, but I understand that not everyone can afford one. In that case, my advice is to get a buddy who really cares about you to help you. 

Make sure your exercise form is on point. You might think you're a legend on the seated-row machine, but you might well be doing it wrong and looking like a boob. If you are new to working out and don't have a trainer, ask for advice on proper form from people around you. Those big muscly guys usually love to help, I promise. 

Thanks for reading, good luck."

Please [see my graph](https://imgur.com/a/huiL1qV) of my (almost) two years consistent lifting progress

**Details/Story**
I read the Fitness Wiki, the whole thing, 2 or 3 times. I chose my program and I followed GZCLP and made moderate progress for the first year. Went to the gym 3x per week, ate 140g of protein per day and enough calories that I gained 20lbs over the year. Happy enough so far with my slow but steady progress. I was 20lbs away from benching body weight. 

After a couple of resets/deloads on GZCLP I assumed I was out of the linear phase so at the 1 year mark of lifting and bought the 5/3/1 2nd Edition. I perhaps foolishly wanted to ""cut"" for the summer. So around March 2019 I started 5/3/1 BBB and started a cut. I continued to eat 140g protein daily and ate few enough calories that I lost 15 lbs body weight over the 25 week period until August 2019. After my ""cut"" - I still looked weak (no muscle to show off really), and my max lifts had dropped quite a lot. Bummer.

Since Aug 2019 I started eating more, gained weight back up to 170 lbs, my lifts are only just returning to where they were at the year 1 mark.  

Looking at the graph I did OK first year, still slow by Reddit standards. A lot of folks seem to be able to 2 plate bench within a year of lifting. I was still unable to bench BW. My second year seems like a total waste. I'm not any stronger, I can't lift any more, I look the same. I weigh the same. Still can't bench BW.

**To prevent some common answers coming back:**
* I sleep 7.5 - 8 hours every night, I feel it is good quality. I wake up fresh and am never tired during the day. I'm a very regular 11PM - 6:45AM sleeper.
* I work in an office M-F 8-5 (sedentary) - I don't do cardio, just the 3 or 4 lift days per week
* I am happy and fairly low stressed
* I have decent form, not perfect, but I learnt by watching Alan Thrall, writing notes. I'm reasonably confident my form is not holding back my mediocre lifts.
* Am I putting in enough effort? I used to compete in rowing at University. I've done many 2km races, and 3x6km pieces, I know what physical exertion feels like. On my AMRAP sets I do go to failure and I'm not taking it easy.
* Deload weeks. I travel for work about 1 or 2 weeks every 3 months. Those were my ""off weeks"". Apart from those I was in the gym as per the program. 

**People of FITNESS, here are my questions:**
* 1) Should I not have cut? Did dropping 15lbs BW prevent me from getting stronger? I feel like at my mediocre lifting level level it should not have.
* 2) Should I just keep bulking until I hit maybe 190 or 200 lbs? (Remember I'm 5ft 10)
* 3) If the answer to 1) is true, that you have to bulk to get stronger, how come I see people on r/fitness the same height and weight as me who can do double my lifts but they only weigh 170lbs? 
* 4) Why after 2 years and circa 300 times in the gym am I barely able to squat 2 plates and still can't bench my BW? 
* 5) Should I get a testosterone test (30% serious)

I explained her that a programm needs to have a squat, hinge, horizontal push, horizontal pull, vertical pull, vertical push and some ab/core training.

She does a full body workout twice a week alternating workout a and workout b. In workout a she does glute bridge for glutes and posterior chain but what would be the best option for workout b? She has a bit of difficulities with glute activation.

I was thinking about an easy deadlift variation like kettlebell rdl but are there any other good options?"

I’m a 26 y/o male and have no knowledge in this area so please take it easy on me.

I’m roughly 5 years into my fitness journey. In the first ~2 years of said journey, i lost roughly 120 lbs. in fat. In the years since, I’ve been focusing on my diet &amp; exercise, keeping the fat away. I got into cardio and bought a set of selecttech dumbbells. I would like to get a gym membership eventually but right now, I’m saving money and a larger issue has been affecting me.

When I was younger, I apparently fractured my back. I had no idea at the time &amp; found out years later when I had x-rays taken. I’m not informed on the medical terms or exact details but, essentially, some of my vertebre are fusing together, which causes me to have a bit of a hunch in my mid- back when I bend over and (pretty much) constant discomfort/ pain.

One of the things that has kept me sane is seeing myself improve in my fitness journey. I’ve been doing a couple of very basic dumbbell workouts sporadically - presses, curls, push-up to rows, etc., and when I do so for extended periods of time, I really do see great progress in my arms and I am happy with where I get.

However, around this point, I also start to have worsening back pain. I know it’s not entirely the weightlifting that causes this, but it definitely contributes. 

Anyone have any suggestions for exercises or things that I CAN do that won’t affect my back as much? Obviously presses &amp; exercises where my back will be kept against a firm surface are best, but I can only get so far. Would curls with low weight/high reps be beneficial versus high weight/low reps?

I am not necessarily trying to get HUGE. Some size would be nice, but I’d more so like to be tone/fit.

I've been out of shape for years, and cardio is my biggest obstacle.  I've lost 25 pounds in the past 3 months. I'm extremely determined to achieve a goal of being fit, but I have no clue what I'm doing. I have a lot of questions and would greatly appreciate any help.

1. My workouts are usually a mixture of running between half mile and 2 miles, bicep curls, tricep work, leg presses, swimming, and three times a week I go hiking after working out for about 3 miles or so. I would love to get a better routine because I just made up my workouts without knowing what to do. I need to be much stronger, weigh less, and also be quick enough to get a great mile and a half time.

2. Is it better to workout in the morning or evening? I usually start my day by working out on an empty stomach around 5am or so, then carbing up and eating protein an hour after working out. Would it be better to eat beforehand or to workout at night instead?

3. I want to be able to nail my physical test requirements really well. I'm having issues with my run, though. I've dropped off a ton of time just the past month of dedicating a lot of work on it, but I don't really know HOW to run. How do I control my breathing and heart rate when I run? Should I run with a high heart rate or keep it lower and go farther?  

4. When I run, my tendons (I'm assuming) hurt more than my muscles. I'm finished with shin splints, so that's great, but my groin tendons and knees hurt after and when I run sometimes. Any idea why/how to stop or make these less of an issue?

5. I can't use any protein powders or pre-workouts, because I'll be not allowed any during any training and I want to replicate that before I ship out. I've got between 3 and 7 months to get my physical stuff taken care of, but the biggest issue is food. I hear so many conflicting things that I don't know what or how or when to eat sometimes.

For a little backstory, I’m 6’2” male 22 and started at 245. I’m currently at 235 using CICO and it’s only been 2 weeks. I’m trying to lose 2 lbs a week so I’ve decreased my ttde by 1000 putting me at 1590. I’ve also included 200 calories per workout 4 times a week and 100 calories for 3 runs. Sometimes I don’t workout the full hour or run a full mile either so it’s a forgiving estimate of about 1730.

I understand it’s only been 2 weeks, however I’m worried about losing muscle and losing weight too fast. I understand it may just be water weight and have read that you should wait a couple weeks to increase your calories, I mostly just want to know how long I need to wait before increasing. I’m trying not to lose as much muscle mass as I can, and want to avoid yo-yoing by losing it too quickly (I did that before on keto). 

I could be really underestimating my calories but I try my best to make sure they’re accurate. I just bought a scale for my meats (I’ll usually just divide the package into the servings, meaning some days I probably get more and some days I probably get less) but everything else is usually in teaspoons so it’s not hard to measure.

Also as a bonus question, if let’s say I lift and run one day and don’t lift or run the next day, should I decrease my calories on the second day, or is it okay to average them out between the two days?

I train deadlift at least once a week. 2 months ago I switched my routine to PPL, which helped push me past a wall for squats. I’ve also tried cleaning up my sleeping schedule and diet.

Below are measured actual 1RM unless indicated. 

May 2019

Weight 176lbs
Shoulder Press 82.5 
Deadlift 245
Squat 240
Bench 135


Sept 2019 

Weight 192lbs 
Shoulder Press N/A
Deadlift 265
Squat 255
Bench 155

Felt uncomfortable with the weight gained since I gained too much too quickly for what I thought I was aiming for (0.5lbs per week). Cut down to about 182 from Sep to Dec 2019, still on 531 BBB. 

Jan 2020 

Weight 187

Shoulder Press 100
Deadlift 275
Squat N/A
Bench 180



So now I've finished my 7th cycle of BBB and the program has caught up to what I can actually do for bench. Shoulder press and deadlift are getting there too.

So I guess what I'm looking for is any general advice or comments of my past year. Nutrition wise, it's been decent where I've been cooking for myself majority of the time. Reaching the 2400 calories according MyFitnessPal hasn't been too difficult but the protein has been a bit harder sometimes (aiming for about 170ish g)

Sleep can be better and on average I would say it's a 4/7 solid night of sleep between consistency and number of hours slept.

Ideally I would like to continue to work on my strength for a while longer before I consider cutting in a few months. If there's any other program suggestions I would be open. Don't know if I'm still considered a beginner or not.

Also a small note: some might notice I don't have any squat numbers. Also do hockey once a week and before that combined with squatting had been causing knee pain.

1. Be in a deficit
2. Be consistent

There is also exercising, which will help you improve your body shape (fat-to-muscle ratio) rather than just make you a smaller version of your current self.

A 20% deficit is the popular recommendation (and my personal preference). But that does not mean that it is superior to any other deficit. Whether you choose a 10% deficit or a 50% deficit, that is purely by preference. Whichever you choose, it should be based on whether you can be **consistent** with it. If you don't like being hungry, go for a small deficit. If you don't like being fatigued, go for a medium deficit. If you have the willpower of a donkey, go for a larger deficit. As long as you can stick to it, pick whichever you want.

There is no one diet that is superior to another. In studies where calories were matched, all diets performed the same. A diet is just a set of rules which was designed to help you restrict caloric intake without counting calories. Whichever diet you choose, its a decision based on whether it will help you **be in a deficit**, and if it's simple enough so that you are **consistent** with it. Nothing else matters. You can just ignore all the so called gurus arguing with everyone on the internet on what is most optimal for weight loss. For you personally, choose the diet that is easiest to follow in the long run. If you tried them all and none of the existing diets work for you, or if you broke consistency in the past because they were too restrictive, then your best bet would be to learn how to count calories, so that you do not have any food restrictions.

Consistency is not about following a ruleset to the letter. You don't need to be in an exact 20% deficit every single day, you don't need to eat exactly 140g of protein, and you don't need to never eat cake again. This mindset is one that eventually fails the consistency rule. If you feel that not eating cake will break your consistency, then consciously eat some cake, and then get back to dieting. Not getting off the train is the important bit. Counting calories is hard? Then track them loosely. Brown or white bread, track them as the same. Fries or wedges, track them the same. You didn't bring your food scale at the restaurant or the family gathering? Then make an approximate guess. Or track the closest alternative. Tracking SOMETHING will always be better than tracking NOTHING because its difficult. My only warning here is to avoid loosely tracking food that is very high in fat, such as butter, mayonnaise etc. If you are out dining, just try to avoid this food altogether. There is a significant margin of error when loosely tracking fat.

Social life is too demanding? Well if that's a dealbreaker, don't sacrifice it either. Make conscious choices to add it into your daily life. If you eat at maintenance or at a surplus one day but you are still in an average weekly deficit, this is still the same as being in a deficit. But do make decisions that you can incorporate for the long run. Opt for better food choices at restaurants. Try to moderate your alcohol when going out. Don't order dessert if you are full. Opt to drink a litre of water instead of eating a kebab after drinking night out. All these small things add up and help you remain on an average weekly deficit, without compromising on your social life.

I'll add one final mindset rule which will help consistency. When you wake up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror, you may see no difference and think that all this effort was for nothing. Don't let that break you. As long as you are moving towards the right direction, just keep doing what you are doing. You will eventually see the difference. Especially towards the end, when you lose the last couple of pounds and muscle definition starts appearing.

My wife just had our first (and only) child, a bright-eyed little boy. We're about a week in. It's been extremely exhausting at times (most times). Some times we get very, very little sleep.

So here's the thing: I get a lot of advice from family, friends, and medical professionals. But there's one thing that none of them know anything about: maintaining fitness. Most of my friends are not unfit, but they also don't regularly work out and certainly didn't work out when their child was younger than 2 years old. **So I have zero reference for how staying fit with a newborn can be done*****.*** Is it possible? My wife and I share *a lot* of the responsibility. I am not one of those 20% dads (like my dad, and some of my friends); I am on the clock 23.5 hours a day.

First, I'd love your general advice and to hear your experiences. I also have some specific questions.

1. How much is it even feasible I stay in shape? Is my fitness journey in a holding pattern? I am naturally very thin (thin but not lean... 140 @ 5'10 and 18% BF when at my baseline), so any time off means I lose all the lean mass it took me lots of time to build.
2. How productive is working out when so tired? My wife knows how important the gym is to me for my mental and physical wellbeing. Last night she insisted I take 45 minutes (we live near the gym) and work out. I was weaker (obviously... exhausted and not eating enough). But this still does me some good, right? Rather than nothing at all.
3. A m[an's testosterone drops up to 36%](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/fatherhood-decreases-testosterone), [permanently](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/39/16194), [after becoming a father](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pair-bonding%2C-fatherhood%2C-and-the-role-of-A-review-Grebe-Sarafin/2ffe5ed739b1ea0ccc53278b5f079bf8c58b99d1) (and after statistically controlling for factors like sleep, stress, and activity levels). Did this affect you all at all? Did you notice getting weaker and fatter, even though your activity remained the same? (There's not a linear relationship between endogenous test levels and muscularity in most male populations, keep in mind. Not saying fatherhood is a death sentence for gains.)

1. How much is it even feasible I stay in shape? Is my fitness journey in a holding pattern? I am naturally very thin (thin but not lean... 140 @ 5'10 and 18% BF when at my baseline), so any time off means I lose all the lean mass it took me lots of time to build.
2. How productive is working out when so tired? My wife knows how important the gym is to me for my mental and physical wellbeing. Last night she insisted I take 45 minutes (we live near the gym) and work out. I was weaker (obviously... exhausted and not eating enough). But this still does me some good, right? Rather than nothing at all.
3. A m[an's testosterone drops up to 36%](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/fatherhood-decreases-testosterone), [permanently](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/39/16194), [after becoming a father](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pair-bonding%2C-fatherhood%2C-and-the-role-of-A-review-Grebe-Sarafin/2ffe5ed739b1ea0ccc53278b5f079bf8c58b99d1) (and after statistically controlling for factors like sleep, stress, and activity levels). Did this affect you all at all? Did you notice getting weaker and fatter, even though your activity remained the same? (There's not a linear relationship between endogenous test levels and muscularity in most male populations, keep in mind. Not saying fatherhood is a death sentence for gains.)

Thanks all. Really appreciate this subreddit!"

I'm dummy, can you please elaborate/explain?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've read, weekly volume should be around **10-20** sets per muscle group (both beginner and experienced).

So if I understand it correctly, I **COULD** cram like **12** sets of **each** excersise into **one workout** (day), then rest for **6** days and from the muscle development perspective it would work? I mean it would take like 4 hours and it would kill me (and the form would be all over the place, plus many other negative effects), but do I understand it correctly?

Also, am I overthinking it and should I just pick ""regular"" plan and do 3x a week split or 3x a week full body? If I went with 4 sets per muscle with 3x a week splits I would hit all the muscles with only 4 sets, while with 3x a week full body I would hit it 12 times. What is better for a beginner?

&amp;#x200B;

**I am very much a beginner** (2 months of 5x a week, full body, **bodyweight** exercise).

I'm gonna start with weights soon and I'm picking a workout plan now.

I'm leaning towards 3x a week full body workout. It scares me a little, but I just kind of like it, I have time to do it and I'm looking forward to it.

31m 96kg/211lbs 6""2 roughly 20% Body Fat

I have been a long time lurker, but decided to post my issue here.

So I have trained for the last 8 years semi seriously and have got my body into some great conditions and also some not - so great conditions.

As many I usually use Jan as a hard reset and decided to sort myself out post Christmas indulgence.

I was following the Built With Science Intermediate Shred (Jeremy Eithier) for a long time and saw minimal to relatively ok improvements which was good. But I wanted more of an impact so have moved to the Fundamentals program by Jeff Nippard (both science based).

The first few days have been really good and I feel the pump from the sessions way more than the BWS program.

I am following the nutrition guide as much as possible (hitting protein levels each day by drinking a myprotein vegan blend).

In terms of Cardio I have a Peloton which has been brilliant so far (3 weeks in) starting on the beginner rides starting to get harder and really build up a sweat.

The issue I have is that I want to shred fat and lean up whilst build muscle but since increasing intake of calories (although still at a deficit from TDEE) my measured weight has gone up.

Does anyone have any advise? 

Is it normal in a recomp?

Ive only been doing it for a month or so....I know it can take a long time but if my weight has gone UP surely thats a bad sign?

Any insight or comments welcome.

(TL:DR) New recomp is making me heavier despite calorie deficit and  increased Cardio/Weight training.

Before I got into lifting, I would go for 1 month memberships and mess around but nothing serious since my lifestyle was complemented with sedentary jobs, weed and alcohol. 4 months ago I started the Reddit PPL (while watching or reading a lot of content in order to broaden my knowledge) and also fixed my routine and eating. I have seen people here switch programs and alternate between PPL, PHUL etc. I actually love PPL because I love going to the gym 6 times a week and maybe even 7 if I feel like doing some cardio or additional ab work. I'm also getting stronger each time at my main lifts which makes me feel like sticking to the routine.

Hello r/Fitness, I'm a beginner lifter who has been doing it for about 4 months. I used to play football (soccer) when I was a kid and I also go swimming a lot during summer (beach is really close). Before I got into lifting, I would go for 1 month memberships and mess around but nothing serious since my lifestyle was complemented with sedentary jobs, weed and alcohol. 4 months ago I started the Reddit PPL (while watching or reading a lot of content in order to broaden my knowledge) and also fixed my routine and eating. I have seen people here switch programs and alternate between PPL, PHUL etc. I actually love PPL because I love going to the gym 6 times a week and maybe even 7 if I feel like doing some cardio or additional ab work. I'm also getting stronger each time at my main lifts which makes me feel like sticking to the routine.

My main lifts (5x5 except Deadlift which is 3x5):

Deadlift : 100 kg
Squat: 75 kg
Bench: 67.5 kg
Barb Row: 60 kg
OHP: 50 kg

My question is, should I stick with the program or try to switch things up?"

I'm eating between 700-850 calories a day. I'm 6ft 1"" if that matters and somewhere around 16-20% body fat (my scales at 16% however there's always going to be up to a 5% variable with these scales)

So far so good, I'm getting great pumps at the gym, I don't really track strength, I more or less just train to failure on each exercise but it doesn't seem like strength has decreased at all which is good. Overall I'm having great workouts.

The question is if I wanted to speed up my weight loss or if I stall at any point would a decent cheat day full of junk high cal foods be good for my metabolism? At the moment everything's fine but I'm just wondering for when I hit a wall, I don't do cardio either however my sessions are very intense so I feel as though I'm getting a decent return from my sessions, not only for making gains but I'm maybe burning a few extra calories. Obviously cals burned during weight sessions isn't anything, its still something.

For some reason I'm under the impression that cheat day once a week or every couple of weeks keeps your fat loss consistent, however I don't try it because I don't want to potentially gain weight",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7648549,public,,self,,,Losing weight and eating junk food,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/evkaqb/losing_weight_and_eating_junk_food/,all_ads,6.0,"Losing weight and eating junk food Hi everyone,

Recently she's said she was tiring of using the circuit weight machines, and wanted to venture into free weights, but said she's not confident in using them, and wouldn't know where to begin, or how to put together a workout, and would want a spotter.  So I volunteered to go there to be her spotter and help.

Since she/we can only go twice a week, she can't really focus on one muscle group a day, but instead would want to do a whole body workout, maybe a couple of exercises, that hit each group, in that 60 - 90 minutes.

So my question is what are maybe 8 total free weight lifts that she could start with that give a whole body exercise, with a focus on toning (thinking 3 sets of 15/12/10 for each exercise).

So far I have bench press, bicep curls, tricep extensions, single arm row, seated shoulder press for upper body.  Squats and lunges w/ dumbbells for lower body.  Seated ball crunch for abs/core.

I'm new to weight lifting and have started a basic PPL program to start bulking up.

Four days would be much better, but unfortunately I can't go to the gym Friday-Sunday. Monday-Thursday is the most I could possibly do in one week.

Is it okay to lift four days in a row with three consecutive days off following that? Are there any good routines that fit that kind of schedule? Or should I just keep it at three days per week so that I can have a rest day somewhere in between?

Now, I'm starting to see some muscle growth in my chest and I've noticed that my chest muscles where they connect to the sternum or ""dip"" crackle a lot usually when I'm slouched for a period and stretch my back out.

Is it possible to fix this issue with proper posture and focusing more on building a chest and upper back? Will I ever be able to have a ""flat"" chest.

I've lifted sporadically over the years, but never seriously. It's been many years since I last lifted but in September I started going to the gym again. Since October I've been doing PHUL and making steady gains. I have meticulously studied proper form. I hit the gym Mon-Fri, do my weights then use the exercise bike. I'm eating at a slight calorie defect as I want to lose some fat. I have put on a noticeable amount of muscle during this time. 

I've been increasingly struggling with squats and deadlifts. More so with my squats, I think deadlifts have just caught some friendly fire while my confidence was being assassinated.

**Problem**

I was making steady progress on squats up until about 90kg or so, I don't remember exactly. I'm aiming for 4x5 reps, if I achieve it, I do it again the next week to make sure it's locked, then the following week I up the weight 5kg. 

Using this method I've progressed to 100kg. However, at both 95kg and especially now at 100kg, every rep is a huge struggle. As if it's my last rep on the last set, a deep squat followed by a slow and almost stalled rise, yet I can still do 4x5 100kg.

However, the struggle at 100kg has really knocked my confidence and I've realised that this has destroyed my form. I've also realised that in order to boost my confidence I've been allowing myself to use poor form to achieve reps. For example, letting my hips come up first, requiring me to then to re-straighten my back to align my centre of gravity. Occasionally I catch myself doing this and do the next rep in perfect form, but then that rep is even harder and my confidence decreases more so.

I guess I've been ignoring it because it's demoralising, but I realised today that it is not sustainable and I will likely injure myself. I'm not going to allow the poor form to continue, but I really don't know what else I should do. Should I decrease the weight and focus on form? If so, how much?

**Conclusion**

I've tried bro split, push pull, lower upper, but I just lose interest and stop doing it at all.

Last  month or so, I've been doing some sort of full body 5-6x a week, and  even tho muscle fatigue and what not, I can actually perform heavy lifts  concistenly.

My problem is this type of split is the bro in me saying that there will be no gains.

My workout consists of (5-6x week):

\- 5x5 squat (60%/70%/80%/80%/90%)

\- 5x5 bench press (60%/70%/80%/80%/80%)

\- 5x5 deadlift (60%/70%/80%/80%/80%)

\- 5x5 OHP (60%/70%/80%/80%/90%)

\- Whatever I'm feeling after, curls, abs, shoulders. I just do what I feel like in the moment.

I  only go to 90% on each lift twice a week, so there is some sort of  ""rest"", for example, if I'm doing 90% bench press and deadlift on  monday, I will do 80% on the rest of the main lifts, and rotate the  lifts that I'm going for 90%.

After  a couple of weeks, I guess my body adapted, and I have just a minor  sore all the time, everywhere, but is that kinda of pain that it's fine,  I even forget about it.

Does anyone run a highly heavy compound movement focused full body split?

Should I stop doing all compound movement everyday, and split them beetwen days?

This  split is actually working wonders for me, at least by making me  actually wanting to work out when I get home from work. I'm actually  excited to work out again, like when I first started some years back.

Hey guys! I am new here my name is Elvis!

Just wanted to share [my progress](https://ibb.co/zNsWnTq) in losing weight with everyone! I posted my progress on Reddit in other group and received excellent feedback which motivates me even more to work hard and never give up on my goal and dream! I figured that my journey belongs in this community too because sometimes I go to the gym (sometimes I do gym work, calisthenics, cardio so fitness in general) and I am a bodybuilding fan. 

Lets hope this post motivates someone because nothing feels better than motivate someone else with your hard work! 

Some background about me I used to go to the gym and I trained a powerlifter style 3-5 rep range. I always was big but never lean. I got quite strong and still am but I always wanted to be lean and ripped.

Having a 6 pack was my goal even at very young age but I always find some excuse to eat wrong foods. But somehow last summer around mid July I listened to a audiobook some people might know it some not. The book is written by David Goggins it's called ""Can't hurt me"" and I have to say it changed my life completely.

It ignited the fire and motivation that I needed for the breakthrough and after that I set myself my own goals! Now eating clean diet with maybe 5% cheat food is my new lifestyle. I pretty much live the lifestyle which seemed unreasonable before!

I workout pretty much everyday (I don't recommend this to beginners) and my diet is high in protein with healthy fats (omega's) and complex carbs like oatmeal for example. 

I don't drink soda, nor I eat fast food, I am not a smoker and I seldom drink. At first you might think this lifestyle is boring but when you realize that health should be your number one priority in life your thinking changes! 

Little story my blood pressure was very high for my weight and height. Maybe because of powerlifting im not sure.. or maybe because I have high genetic BP so I have to live healthy to sustain my good health so when I get older I still have amazing health and strong heart etc. So this is very important to me. Every kg/lbs of weight just raises my blood pressure.

People get used to everything and that was key for me. I just had to get trough the first two weeks of diet and a lot of exercise before I get used to it. Now it's my lifestyle and so far I have lost 20kg/45lbs. I look better, I feel better, my sleep has improved, my mood is not that aggresive and depressed I think more positive about life in general. I don't regret not eating sweet stuff like candy at all after a while you just don't even crave it that much. And in my opinion this is the only way to get the results we want. We have to change the lifestyle/mindset to actually progress!

I have my entire journey filmed and I made a transformation/motivation video so if someone is interested in my journey you can check me out on YouTube just type ElvisLifts and you will find me! Any support is highly appreciated!

If you have any questions feel free to ask!

Hey guys! I am new here my name is Elvis!

And therefore want to make a physical change in myself to become stronger to better meet the needs of my job and those who need me.

To prepare for the lift I drank two protein shakes, had a bagel with lox, some nuts, and ate 12 eggs (don't judge lmao) but it all started last week on the 23rd I hit 315 for 12 reps at RPE of 9.5. and then another set at 10 reps and realized I was at 1rm of 441 and that I should be able to hit 4 plates now.

____________________________________________



There is a lot of varying schools of thought when it comes to the amount of training a person should be doing. It is very easy to become confused while trying find the to place that lies between ‘not doing enough’ and overtraining. With MMA careers like Cain Velasquez being cut short supposedly due to overtraining, more and more fighters are beginning to take note of ways to avoid injury and overtraining.

You may not be a fighter but you rely on your body functioning properly to earn an income… Or, maybe you just don’t want to get injured so you can continue to do the things you enjoy, and live an active lifestyle… Whatever the reason you don’t want to get injured, here are some guidelines to help keep you off the sidelines.

First we must understand what ACUTE and CHRONIC workload is. Here is a very simplified breakdown of the two:

ACUTE WORKLOAD
The amount of training done in a week.

CHRONIC WORKLOAD
The weekly average training done over 4 week period

The way I like to try and track/measure my weekly training, is to give it a value by multiplying the minutes by the intensity.

EXAMPLE

Monday – 60 min x 8/10 intensity = 60 x 8 = 480
Tuesday – 90 min x 6/10 intensity = 90 x 6 = 540
Wednesday – rest 
Thursday – 45 min x 9/10 intensity = 45 x 9 = 405
Friday – 60 mins x 5/10 intensity = 60 x 3 = 300

480 + 540 + 405 + 300 = 1725
Acute workload = 1725

Week 4 – 1725 
Week 3 – 1500
Week 2 – 1600
Week 1 – 1700

1725 + 1500 + 1600 + 1700 = 1631.25
Chronic workload = 1631.25

Now that we understand what chronic workload and acute workload are, we can figure out the ratio between the two by dividing the ACUTE load by the CHRONIC load.

ACUTE : CHRONIC
1725 : 1631
= 1.06
ACUTE : CHRONIC RATIO = 1.06

Great! We know our Acute : Chronic workload ratio… So, what?

Finding this number is important because if we keep it below 1.3 it significantly decreases our likelihood of getting injured. 

How do we do this? By progressively increasing training to get to the fitness level we need, rather than doing it all at once. This means, if we have a Chronic workload of 1000 but we need to be doing an acute workload of 2500 in order to be prepared for a fight, we need to increase to this over a number of weeks. 

If we were to do this in one week, this is what happens to our acute : chronic workload ratio:

2500:1000
Acute : Chronic ratio = 2.5. 
Much higher than our 1.3 we are aiming to stay below.

A safe way to stay under 1.3 is to increase training load by 10% each week. This will put your Acute : Chronic workload ratio at around the 1.1. This also leaves you a little room for error if you have a particularly hard session that you didn’t plan on having, or training runs a little bit longer occasionally.

This also means returning from injuries needs to be planned out properly, as taking multiple weeks from training back to back will seriously affect your chronic workload. Returning to a full training schedule could leave you at serious risk of injury.

https://www.scienceforsport.com/acutechronic-workload-ratio/

Whether you are a fighter or a beginner, I strongly suggest you plan ahead when it comes to increasing your training. Deciding on what your workload needs to be is a very difficult question to answer, and will vary depending on what your goals are, but if you plan ahead and keep your acute : chronic workload ratio in mind, you are able ton control your likelihood of getting an injury along the way.",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7646899,public,,self,,,HELP: want to give advice to my students but don't want to tell the wrong info,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ev1932/help_want_to_give_advice_to_my_students_but_dont/,all_ads,6.0,"HELP: want to give advice to my students but don't want to tell the wrong info Basically I want to best educate my students in my boxing and muay thai gym on how to NOT get injured.

Unfortunately almost a year ago I re-tore it, same spot, doing pec flys and it hasn’t healed since. I started by doing nothing like the first time but it wouldn’t go away fully. 

Though the Rhomboid injury seems to have healed there’s a really bad knot a few inches below the original injury that aches every single day for the most part. I’ve started PT a couple months ago, have gotten injections, worked on my posture, ice and heat, and get it massages or rolled but even after getting okayed to do light back and chest exercises, the knot is as bad as ever and the pain is radiating down my arm. My best guess is that it’s Myofacial pain or a knot in my erector spinae. 

I’m kinda losing it here guys, really want more than anything to be able to work out normally but it just won’t go away. Has anyone had a similar injury and have any advice? Only thing I haven’t done is gotten an MRI but the Doctor and PT I have seen say that it wouldn’t really do much.

About a year and a half ago I tore my Rhomboid, stopped doing any working out for 8 weeks and it was back to normal. Unfortunately almost a year ago I re-tore it, same spot, doing pec flys and it hasn’t healed since. I started by doing nothing like the first time but it wouldn’t go away fully. 

Though the Rhomboid injury seems to have healed there’s a really bad knot a few inches below the original injury that aches every single day for the most part. I’ve started PT a couple months ago, have gotten injections, worked on my posture, ice and heat, and get it massages or rolled but even after getting okayed to do light back and chest exercises, the knot is as bad as ever and the pain is radiating down my arm. My best guess is that it’s Myofacial pain or a knot in my erector spinae.

TL;DR at the bottom. 

My friends recently talked me into going to the gym with them. I've been planning to for a while, but nothing's ever stuck without some outside motivation or accountability. Now that I've got that, I'm excited to get on the road to fitness and loving my body, as I've always been a lot softer and a bit chunkier than I'd like to be. 

We plan to go M T TH F, for roughly an hour. I'd go Wednesday and Saturday too, if it accelerated my goals, honestly. I also have a lot later in the day obligations than them, so I can stay as long as I need at the gym. 

Right now, I have 2 goals:

1. Increase my blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health- currently my resting BP is between 85/55 and 95/65. I experience regular dizzy spells, vision impairment when standing quickly, and faintness. My endurance is also virtually nonexistent. I can't keep up a slow jog for more than around 2 minutes. 

2. Lose roughly 20-30lbs, targeting my stomach, thighs, bottom, and hips (in order of priority). I'm more interested in getting to a comfortable shape than number, so I doubt I'll check my weight often. 

I'm not interested in bulking or gaining strength really, as I'm fairly strong and am happy with my capabilities outside of my poor endurance. 

So, where do I even start? I'm willing to put in 2 hours 4-6 times a week, I'm willing to alter my diet completely. Right now I'm fairly attentive to protein and water intake to help with my blood pressure. Other than that, I really don't eat much. I snack on carb-y foods like chips (those are my weakness really), and a scoop or two of ice cream here and there. Less sweets now, as recently sweets make me feel kinda sick after 4 or 5 bites. I make egg/cheese/deli meat sandwiches as my go to at home, and protein bars as my work snack during long shifts. 



TL;DR- What's a good diet and exercise base routine for someone looking to increase cardiovascular health and lose 20-30lbs in stomach, hips, thighs and bottom area? 1-2 hours 4-6 days a week available for workouts.

I started on 5mg quick release, and a month later moved to 10mg. Today I switched to an extended release 30mg form of Adderall. Before anyone says I shouldn’t be on it, and  that it’s terrible for me. Just know it has changed my life completely, and that I am using it legally.  I am also trying to build good habits, so that I can eventually stop taking it. 

I am a 30 year old male. I am 6’0 ft, and weigh 190 lbs.  I have a CT muscle composition. (Not sure that this is needed information) I have played hockey and other sports my entire life, and was actually in really good shape up until about 3 years ago when I got a bad concussion. It all went down hill from there.  But, even though I was a great athlete, and played Hockey my whole life, I never learned anything about fitness, because I didn’t think I needed to.  (I was fortunate enough to be naturally built and  fit and never had issues with my health, so I would never work out. I now know that was really stupid of me) 

Now for the real reason I am here. I have started making better life choices when it comes to my health. I started running on a treadmill 3 times per week, and eating healthier.  I have now been running since mid November and I am loving it. However, I decided to to look up what my heart rate should be at while running, and the AHA says that my target heart rate should be about 95-162 for a 30 year old male.

I’ll start off by saying I have recently as September 2019 started taking Adderall. I started on 5mg quick release, and a month later moved to 10mg. Today I switched to an extended release 30mg form of Adderall. Before anyone says I shouldn’t be on it, and  that it’s terrible for me. Just know it has changed my life completely, and that I am using it legally.  I am also trying to build good habits, so that I can eventually stop taking it. 

I am a 30 year old male. I am 6’0 ft, and weigh 190 lbs.  I have a CT muscle composition. (Not sure that this is needed information) I have played hockey and other sports my entire life, and was actually in really good shape up until about 3 years ago when I got a bad concussion. It all went down hill from there.  But, even though I was a great athlete, and played Hockey my whole life, I never learned anything about fitness, because I didn’t think I needed to.  (I was fortunate enough to be naturally built and  fit and never had issues with my health, so I would never work out. I now know that was really stupid of me) 

Now for the real reason I am here. I have started making better life choices when it comes to my health. I started running on a treadmill 3 times per week, and eating healthier.  I have now been running since mid November and I am loving it. However, I decided to to look up what my heart rate should be at while running, and the AHA says that my target heart rate should be about 95-162 for a 30 year old male.  Now my heart rate is typically in the 145-160 range when jogging at a 5.0 on the treadmill. But at the end of each run, I’ll sprint for a minute at a 12.0 and my heart rate goes up to the 170-185 range. Should I be concerned with this at all? Or is this normal for a 30 year old?

  For starters, I am a biochemistry undergrad student. Take my words with a grain of salt, and please correct me where I’m wrong. My boyfriend is probably very similar to a lot of you. Gym loving and wanting to gain muscle and strength safely and quickly. He does everything religiously correct in the gym, but his pre-workout routine was a mess. He was taking a crazy number of supplements. He didn’t have any CLUE as to what was in these supplements, or what stacking them could do. After a lot of prodding from me, he now takes a MUCH simpler preworkout that I’ve come up with. I’d like to share the sense I talked to him and clear up a lot of nonsense that supplement companies are spewing. 

1. Most of the preworkouts he was taking had the big 3 (caffeine, beta alanine, and L-citrulline). These are the most studied compounds and most likely to affect your workouts and muscle gains. (1)Caffeine is a real mood changer in the gym and burns fat. It is outrageously safe but watch how much you take. 600mg is the max recommended DAILY amount. Not necessarily meant to be taken at once. (2)Beta alanine lessens fatigue in muscles. It also makes your skin tingle. My boyfriend likes it, I feel like I’m rubbing my nose like a cocaine addict when I take it. It does not need to be taken during workouts, but it is better taken daily to build up stores in the body. Because of the tingling, I think its better during a workout than just sitting at home. (3)L-citrulline expands blood vessels. This will bring more oxygen to the muscle (more energy potential) and can make you look more vascular. I could not find any study that proved L-citrulline improved athletic performance or muscle gains conclusively.

2. Next there were other common additions to his old preworkouts (creatine and BCAA’s). These are also very well studied, but here is where supplement companies get shady. (1)Creatine builds muscle and helps decrease fatigue. We know this for a fact. BUT your body only can use so much creatine and can make it on its own. The rest you pee out because creatine molecules bind to water. If you take creatine with caffeine (a diuretic) you will pee out the creatine, even if you could have used some of it! Do not take creatine and caffeine at the same time. Most likely, you don’t need to supplement creatine (vegetarians might because creatine is found in meat primarily) but taking it in correct dosage will not harm you (the study looking at creatine causing hair loss was questionably done and never verified). If you do take creatine, take it daily. It’s important to have a good store of creating built up in your body, ready for use. Moving on, (2)BCAA stands for branch chain amino acids. These are amino acids your body can’t synthesize itself, and you must eat them. It makes sense we need to supplement these.... but they are in ANY complete protein powder along with the rest of the amino acids. BCAA’s are a total waste of money IF you use a complete protein powder or eat varied protein sources! It’s unnecessary. This was the hardest to convince my boyfriend away from, he had a lot of “but what if’s” and “it can’t hurt” but NO! Waste of money! Creatine might be overkill, but BCAA’s truly are. The people selling BCAA’s must know this, but they sell them anyways because you don’t know this.

3. The final category is basically what I consider fillers. Compounds that might do something, maybe, idk, we haven’t reaaaally studied it and the results are sometimes even inconclusive. So supplement companies say “let’s just throw it in for good measure!” This bullet point is for the \~rest\~ of preworkout supplement ingredients. It’s not all encompassing, because I didn’t look at every ingredient ever. These compounds may have been used in 1 scientific study and gotten slight positive results. They may have been in 10 studies and gotten 3 positive results and 7 neutral results. There may be no studies done on this compound for what the supplement company claims. It’s not easy to tell what’s good science and what’s bullshit. Overall, these compounds are bullshit. We know this because supplement brands are all similarly effective. Else we’d all be taking the one that made us noticeably more jacked or perform better than the rest... But no, we all have our preferences (probably based on the ratios of the main ingredients they all share (see bullet point 1)). This means the random compounds they claim to be their specialty, (or any herbs and random amino acids you see near the bottom of active ingredients) are not separating them from competitors who have their own set of random compounds. Huh....  idk if I’m allowed to call out actual supplement companies, but I’m going to. Bucked Up is expensive and well known. It’s “special ingredient” among others is deer antler velvet extract. According to this study, **(**[**https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14669926**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14669926)**)**  there is insufficient proof to say deer antler extract helps strength or endurance. A compilation of several studies (meta-analysis) said similar: insufficient proof. If you tried to take every supplement that may help, but is not proven, you’d explode. Science has a lot of irons in the fire right now. We should be taking only WELL researched and PROVEN useful ingredients. None of the compounds I’ve mentioned (except maybe caffeine) will change your workout in any drastic, purely positive way (and no, steroids are not purely positive on the body).  Don’t risk your health or waste your money. Another example comes from the pre-workout C4 Dynasty, which is $70 for 20 servings. They list Rauwolfia Vomitoria Extract as an ingredient added to give you “explosive energy.” Rauwolfia is a shrub from Africa, used for a large variety of things by indigenous people including stopping convulsions, inability to sleep (aka this would make you sleep), and stopping vomiting. Not only is it unproven that this extract can increase athletic performance or muscle building, it is banned in Canada because it is deemed unsafe. GEE. I can find a compound (or more likely multiple) like this in every preworkout I see (don’t believe me? Send me yours in my DM’s and I’ll look through the ingredients). 

So why do supplement companies add compounds that aren’t proven to have positive effects (or even are proven to have negligible effects). They need a long ingredient list to ensure you are wowed with the placebo effect and won’t consider making your own preworkout. I believe my boyfriend once said, “well there is a ton of ingredients, one of them has to do something.” I love my boyfriend, but please don’t be like my boyfriend. 

Additionally, a lot of these compounds are NOT studied in long term trials. Taking them daily for years and years could cause adverse effects we aren’t even testing for currently. Another great reason to stick to well-studied ingredients like caffeine, beta alanine, L-citrulline, creatine, and a few others that I’ve not come across or failed to mention. 

Be wary. They probably won’t harm you, but they are also probably a waste of money. Stick to the main compounds and mix them yourself. Or at LEAST verify the ingredients and amounts in your preworkout. This is another huge source of confusing error I see almost every single time. For example, I’ve seen preworkouts with not nearly enough beta alanine, or way too much. Most people agree 2-3g is best. Not 8g. Not 1g. This happens for all the ingredients. Why supplement companies can’t even keep that consistent, I cannot tell ya.  

Finally, if I am wrong about something, just correct me. If its minute and not really important, keep it to yourself and don't be that asshole. This is just my hobby, and I am very nervous to post this because of the potential backlash I could receive. Nonetheless, I honestly believe this is important information and someone has to say it. to help you. 

 TLDR: I truly believe preworkouts contain a lot of unnecessary ingredients. I would always recommend doing your own research (the above is a good place to start) and mixing your own preworkouts with well-studied and proven effective compounds.

So I've been in the gym to some extent since June. Fucked around big time until probably the beginning of November, at which point I started Ivysaur's program. I'd tried lifting in previous years but always fucked around, never stayed consistent and usually quit after a month or so. 

This time round, I've been consistent, never missing a day and making decent progress on my lifts. I train pretty hard and tend to leave the gym feeling fairly exhausted. 

 My diet has been in check, getting around 165g of protein per day and I sleep fairly well too.

Example of current lifts:

Deadlift 100kg x 4

Bench 67.5kg x 4

Squat 85kg x 4 

This is a lot more than I've ever been able to lift before and it feels good to feel stronger relative to how pathetic my lifts were in the past. (I know I'm still weak as fuck objectively speaking)

Having said all this, I'm skinny fat, so I've been trying to recomp, and I almost look worse now than I did a few months ago. Showed my cousin a 'progress' pic and he straight up thought the before was the after photo. 

I'm aware that recomps take a long time but should I not have expected to see at least some minuscule improvement in physique having progressed a fair bit in my lifts? Everything looks exactly the same in my progress pics, I've perhaps even gained an extra KG or two and it seems to have just been fat.

Assisted Pullups - 3x10 (To work lats until I can do unassisted pullups)

Some variation of bicep curl - 3x10

Some variation of tricep exercise - 3x10

Ab work

I'm currently tracking my routine through the Strong app and hoping to increase my compound lifts before switching over to an isolation split once I've hit my goal weight and can focus on bulking to add muscle mass. My main questions are is this too much volume and/or should I rearrange the routine to better optimize the volume? Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

When I was in my Early 20’s I lifted three days a week ran twice a week. During my fitter times I weighed around 180 lbs, could bench 225, squat 240. I was also running for the purpose of scoring well on the Navy Physical readiness Test and always completed the 1.5 mile run closed to 9 minutes. To prepare I was doing 3-5mile training runs at about a 7:00/pace. I did a some semi-competitive 5k organized runs and usually finished in 19-20 minutes

For 12 years after getting out of the military, I got big into Bike racing, both mountain and road. While I never stopped lifting altogether, I lifted less and for the purpose of core strength and injury prevention rather than size and strength. After moving away from the race team I used to train with, and then breaking my arm in two places during a bike wreck, which required 3 surgeries in the course of the following 6 months to install and remove plates and pins, I kind of lost interest in cycling. 

I decided to focus on getting back the muscle strength and size I had when I was younger. I’m back up to 178 lbs (from 160 in my racing days), and although I haven’t checked my Max lifts, I’m doing reps with weight similar to what I lifted in my 20s. I generally consider the lifting to be a success, but I’ve also been running. I lift 3 or 4 days a week and do a couple of runs on non-lifting days. I can tell you that although I am close to equaling my former strength performance, there is no way in hell I’d finish 1.5 miles in under 9 minutes. My pace when I’m pushing it tends to be around 8:00/mile.

Mostly because it would be good for my ego now that I’ve recently turned 40, I’d like to also be able to run nearly as well as I did in my 20’s. I’m thinking about completing a 5k training program from the Garmin website to get myself close to my previous speed around 7 minute miles for 3-5 mile runs. I’m thinking one of the following is true:

1.  I can maintain the size and strength I’ve just worked so hard to gain but doing 2 Full body workouts per week while I work on my running the other days.

2. If I don’t want to lose strength and mass, I’ll have to keep lifting like I have been in addition to my running training which will mean doubling up some days, doing before-work lifts and after-work runs.

3. I am a delusional old man and I just can’t do the things I used to do.

Which of those is most likely? Or is there another option?

I’m 24M, 5’7 (170cm) and weigh 70kg (155lb). I’m no longer in my depressive state which lasted a few years, and decided today is the day I’ll start taking care of my health. 

I have a Cross Trainer in my room and some Dumbbells. I used the Cross Trainer for 20minutes on one of the pre-set “Fat Burning” programs where it loops a set intensity sequence. Multiple times I felt like vomiting, and after 20minutes I had to stop. 

I then started using my dumbbells, adjusted the weight to 7.5kg (16.5lbs), and can manage to do 20 reps each side, then I changed it to 10kg and was able to do two sets of 10 reps before having to lower the amount of reps. 

I’m not fat or skinny. I’m on the “chubby” side. I can do two pull-ups, and I’m able to powerwalk 3km in about 30minutes (which I did yesterday), so average/unfit overall. 

Ideally I would love to get in shape to be able to do indoor-bouldering. It’s a thing I loved to do before I was severely depressed. 

Any advice would be great. Should I sign up to the gym? Or would it be a waste of money at the moment since I can barely exercise without throwing up? How many sets/reps of dumbbell (curls?) should I am for and at what weight? Is there anything I should be eating before/after a workout?

I'm 5ft11 82kg up to date and I've noticed my stomach has popped out a lot with a measurement of 38.5"" which means I look down on my average body and it sticks out a fair amount.

Would switching my workout around and including 45 minutes of cardio twice a week help reduce it within 4-6 weeks with clean eating (high calorie diet)? 

Thanks in advance."

But... I just can't help but feel this way... It's good for you, sure! But it hurts, it sucks, it takes time, it's a chore.

Are there any tips you can give me to actually start liking it? Or is everyone just putting up with it through willpower because of the benefits it brings?"

I suffered a minor pec tear during a bench max attempt about two-and-a-half weeks ago. I did some armchair scientist rehab with the RICE method regularly and diligently, used resistance bands to keep the muscles moving, and have eaten a nice surplus of protein along with good rest. Basically, I didn't go to a doctor is what I'm trying to say. My ROM is pretty much 100% and strength in most types of exertions (minus any heavy pressing motions, obviously) is nearly there again. Largely, I think I got very lucky with the tear because besides some solid scar tissue, weakness in that specific pressing motion, and apprehension to do pressing motions, I am ready to lift again.

My questions are: If I'm returning to the weight room, how can I best ensure that my healthy muscle tissue is still being worked out on? I obviously want to ensure that any imbalances or weaknesses are mitigated, but I don't want to do any remotely heavy pressing motions until I get my ass to a doctor. I was thinking maybe some cable machines might be able to fill that gap, but I'd like a second opinion. Also, with minor injuries like this (and I know, until I visit a doctor I shouldn't be quick to diagnose it, but just from general feeling and analysis I believe it is minor), what is a generally accepted plan of action to ensuring I don't exacerbate my body's recovery efforts while still working out?

My body:
33 y/o M, 88-92 kg ish, 6ft/ 1.81M ish.
Fat on my Belly, it's sticks out a bit but there is also a firmness there. Feels solid enough. 
Fat on my love handles. Lots of it, pure fat (also where I notice it go first when I lose some.)
Fat in my tits, there's some solid muscle underneath but a lot of fat on top and I think I have some breast tissue, I've always had something since teenage years even when I've been slim something's always been there.
Arms, Not very big but little to no fat, just muscle. Slim forarms and small wrists.
Legs: Big Calves, Very big thighs, little to no fat. Always been naturally big and quite strong.

Body History:
Since teenage years I've been up and down in weight, never Super fat,maxing around 95 to 98kg usually less. Maybe 85
I easily can change by kilos in a week, I don't excercise or monitor food, so it just depends on my life.
Around 27 I lost a lot of weight, Due to a few factors.
I was running for the Bus (sprinting) a KM each morning. Work was OT every day and we got Dominoes Pizza (Not pizza doesn't make you slim don't worry) every day. I couldn't face eating it and although sometimes I ate food at home very late (10/11pm or so) Sometimes I wouldn't at all. Guess I lost weight.
Around the same time I stopped my worst vice 3 spoons of sugar in tea and 12 cups a day.
I don't drink as much tea and coffee (sometimes I do) but no sugar at all anymore.
All in all I slimed down to maybe 75KG or less I never weight myself but definitely the healthiest I've been.

Current time. I started going to the gym around 2 times a week witha friend in December. More importantly I eventually started going by myself.
Now I'm going 3 to 4 times a week. Sometimes with my friend sometimes alone (Alone also includes a 2km walk each way, the friend drives lol)

My Goals:
Lose weight, especially body fat. Love Handles and Belly Gone. Tits reduced (I don't know if it's possible to get rid without surgery).

My sessions:
At first I would run 2k on the treadmill in about 15 to 20 mins on an bit if an incline.
Then hit the machines. Though recently I didn't do the cardio.

My Fitness.
I can easily run 2 or 3K from nothing, no previous excercise.
I'm confident I could run 5k on the road. ( I did it years ago)
So in a certain way I'm fitter that you'd expect.
My resting heart rate right now is 54 bpm and it's often lower sometimes into the 40's

When it comes to lifting, it's a mixed bag, I don't think I'm particularly strong, but I find a weight on each machine I reckon I can do 12, 10, 10 reps of.
On some machines I have to dial it back either reduce by one plate or move to 8 or 6 reps.
And I try to use the free weights a bit too though I don't know that many excercises with em.

My routines
When I was going 2 times a week I would do 20 mins of cardio and then use about 5 machines and that would be it.
Going with my friend he plans certain regions but I have no idea of the details. Also he doesn't do much cardio

I'm not able to describe in detail what machines I use as I don't know the names (Is there a resource that details name, use, muscle impacted and has pics?)
Not what weight I lift as I don't keep a record. But I will from tonight.


Machines
Lateral Pulldown (and sometimes the lower varient that's much harder)
The chest one where you bring your arms together like a butterfly
The one you raise above your head
The similar one where you push forward
The hamstring one (really tough but I like pushing myself on that one)
The Opposite one for you legs
The leg press - I hate my gyms one where it's parallel to the groud harder to bring it back as my belly gets in the way. Prefer the one at a 30degree angle.

Also I've been shown and one arm tricep excercise above the head
One hand curls, hammer curls, the one where you lay the bench flat and lean on with one knee and hand and raise the weigh with other hand almost into the armpit.
And two lying two handed free weights and I don't remember the name of either excercise.


Anyway that's where I'm at.
Any tips or advice is welcome.
I've heard conflicting advice on cardio excercise. And I wonder what's best, roadrunning or treadmill.

This started out as a question about running on treadmills versus the road but as I typed it I realised I should really be asking more general questions.

My body:
33 y/o M, 88-92 kg ish, 6ft/ 1.81M ish.
Fat on my Belly, it's sticks out a bit but there is also a firmness there. Feels solid enough. 
Fat on my love handles. Lots of it, pure fat (also where I notice it go first when I lose some.)
Fat in my tits, there's some solid muscle underneath but a lot of fat on top and I think I have some breast tissue, I've always had something since teenage years even when I've been slim something's always been there.
Arms, Not very big but little to no fat, just muscle. Slim forarms and small wrists.
Legs: Big Calves, Very big thighs, little to no fat. Always been naturally big and quite strong.

Body History:
Since teenage years I've been up and down in weight, never Super fat,maxing around 95 to 98kg usually less. Maybe 85
I easily can change by kilos in a week, I don't excercise or monitor food, so it just depends on my life.
Around 27 I lost a lot of weight, Due to a few factors.
I was running for the Bus (sprinting) a KM each morning. Work was OT every day and we got Dominoes Pizza (Not pizza doesn't make you slim don't worry) every day. I couldn't face eating it and although sometimes I ate food at home very late (10/11pm or so) Sometimes I wouldn't at all. Guess I lost weight.
Around the same time I stopped my worst vice 3 spoons of sugar in tea and 12 cups a day.
I don't drink as much tea and coffee (sometimes I do) but no sugar at all anymore.
All in all I slimed down to maybe 75KG or less I never weight myself but definitely the healthiest I've been.

Current time. I started going to the gym around 2 times a week witha friend in December. More importantly I eventually started going by myself.
Now I'm going 3 to 4 times a week. Sometimes with my friend sometimes alone (Alone also includes a 2km walk each way, the friend drives lol)

My Goals:
Lose weight, especially body fat. Love Handles and Belly Gone. Tits reduced (I don't know if it's possible to get rid without surgery).

My sessions:
At first I would run 2k on the treadmill in about 15 to 20 mins on an bit if an incline.
Then hit the machines. Though recently I didn't do the cardio.

My Fitness.
I can easily run 2 or 3K from nothing, no previous excercise.
I'm confident I could run 5k on the road. ( I did it years ago)
So in a certain way I'm fitter that you'd expect.
My resting heart rate right now is 54 bpm and it's often lower sometimes into the 40's

When it comes to lifting, it's a mixed bag, I don't think I'm particularly strong, but I find a weight on each machine I reckon I can do 12, 10, 10 reps of.
On some machines I have to dial it back either reduce by one plate or move to 8 or 6 reps.
And I try to use the free weights a bit too though I don't know that many excercises with em.

I'm a beginner and have been going to the gym for about 1.5 months. I started with a 3-day program training 2 muscle groups a day. chest/biceps, shoulders/triceps, and legs/back on separate days. I have been seeing some progress(mostly on arms/shoulders and somewhat back) but I know that this is not ideal. I would like to hit each muscle group more throughout the week while still going 3 days(my membership is 3 days) so I searched around the net a bit and came up with these two options:

1) two alternating workouts 3 times a week, A and B. A will be chest, tricep, and shoulders. B will be back, biceps and legs. 

OR

2) same alternating workouts but A will be chest back shoulders, B will be legs, triceps, and biceps.

OR

3)Full body workout 3 days a week.

I'm unsure how to go about it.


It is not advisable for me to do squats and deadlifts without strict supervision(if at all) due to a back issue. I don't have any supervision from a qualified person atm so I really don't want to do them. I also feel like benching is not the best thing for me to do for my shoulders. I did that for about a month but it doesn't feel right for some reason. So ideally id like to replace that too. I have been doing leg extensions/curls and leg press instead of deadlift/squads and started doing machine chest press and flies instead of benching. So the exercises that I am doing are:

Chest: chest press, dumbbell flies, machine flies, thinking of adding dumbbell squeeze press.

Back: lat and shoulder pulldowns, t bar machine row and sometimes dumbbell rows(unsure because of scoliosis)

Legs: leg press, leg extensions, and curls.

Biceps: Barbell curls/EZ curls, hammer curls, preacher curls, cable curls.

**Background**

I have been going to the gym on and off for the past few years making no progress.

I've started in 2012 going to the only gym in my city and there was no squat rack and I was doing SL, didn't have motivation and three months later I was out. I was working out upper body a lot more than lower body. Was a pretty boring program, but it was recommended by a ton of people back then. I didn't have that much money and couldn't pay the 30€ monthly fee aswell plus buy a ton of food and protein. I lost motivation and stopped it.

2013-2016 I just did nothing, I was working with no regular schedule and making money at that point was more important than going to the gym. I put on 40kg(88lbs) from 60kg to 100kg because I was making a bit of money and decided to order pizzas every other day. Fuck yeah.

2017 Did a bit of swimming

2018-2019 went to a gym and started doing SL again, didn't really enjoy the environment there. I remember being low in a squat and a ""PT"" coming up to me to give me a handshake. Just stood still with his arm and hand stretched looking at me while I came up from the squat. I remember another where I was running 2 miles and another ""PT"" came up to me to give me a handshake aswell. I was out of breath. Shit's wild, had to leave. They were just way too friendly and I didn't really fit in with the culture.

2020 found a new gym, very cheap, 4 squat racks, a ton of equipment and space. [Just a shitty low bench for bench press](https://shop.lifefitness.com/UserFiles/Documents/Product/05e7aHammerStrength-Olympic=Flat-Bench-L.jpg). I'm 6'4""(193cm) and it's a bit awkward, but other than that I'm not bothered that much unless I'm doing an exercise with shitty form and I usually go when there's no one there at 7AM.

The bit that stuck out most to me was the 3 day per week routine. As I'm only able to get to the gym maximum 3x per week, this seems interesting to me.

If you aren't bothered to read the article I will quote the specific part here:

&gt;The first is to do two sets per movement pattern. If you’re not sure, movement patterns break down as the following: squatting (including lunge variations), hinging (any deadlift variation), pushing (vertical, as in overhead presses, and horizontal, i.e. bench pressing), and pulling (vertical: chinups, horizontal: rows).

“You could go in and do two sets each of incline dumbbell press, flat bench, chinups, rows, front squats, and RDLs,” says Ferruggia. Two days later, go back and change up the exercises. “Or, if you want to get really good at those exercises, keep them for four weeks. But I would change them after that because your joints will start to take a beating. Variety will keep you healthier.”

How you do the two sets is up to you. The first can be heavy, done for low reps, and the second lighter for higher reps. Or, go light first. Or do them both heavy. Experiment to see what works best for you, but understand that “two sets” means work sets and doesn’t include however many sets you need to warm up and build up to the weights you want to use for a particular lift. For instance, if you’re going to squat 300 pounds, you’ll need sets with loads of around 135, 185, 225, and 275 under your belt beforehand to be properly prepared.

And another thing: “leave two reps in the tank on each set,” says Ferruggia. In other words, stop shy of failure. You’re going to again in two days, and you want to be fresh for it. Maxing out regularly on a high-frequency program will burn you out and bring on injuries fast.

The second approach is even more basic. You narrow down your exercises to a single push, pull, and leg movement (rotating options each session), and play with the volume. “You can do 5 sets of 6 Monday, then 3 sets of 12 Wednesday, and Friday do 4 sets of 8,” says Ferruggia. The extra sets let you pound each muscle a little more so it feels more like a traditional body-part or upper-lower split—if that’s what you prefer—but limiting yourself to three basic movements keeps the volume under control. Ferruggia often does these exercises as a circuit for a greater fat-burning effect. Of course, you can throw a few sets of a loaded carry like farmer’s walks, or core/delts/biceps/triceps work in at the end if you like.

What are your thoughts? Pros? Cons? Do you follow a plan similar to this and is it working for you?

2. I don't count calories. I use portion control, using a Glassbake ramiken to measure portions.
3. I overate intentionally, from 8/1/19 - 10/31/19, to put on as much muscle as possible, topping out at [248 lbs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rbnfitness/comments/dfmq2u/success_im_finally_obese/) by 11/1/19. I added a baked potato with sour cream and butter to every meal, in addition to a glass of milk during this time period.
4. 248 lbs. felt quite portly to me. I've been a skinny bean pole all of my life so can't handle looking portly.
5. So not only did I stop eating a baked potato and glass of milk at every meal, I added modified carb restriction. Since 11/1/19, I eat carbs at breakfast, in the form of a cup of oatmeal with 1.75 cups of water. I also eat carbs right before bed at the last meal of the day, eating 1/2 of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a glass of milk. The rest of my meals contain baked chicken and steamed veggies like cabbage or broccoli, although I made [kimchi](https://www.reddit.com/r/kimchi/) for the first time last week and am definitely preferring that as a low carb side dish.
6. Due to #5 above, I am down to 222 lbs. as of today. As I left the gym today, I weighed 222.00 lbs exactly, which means I will probably be down to 221 lbs in the next day or two.
7. I am 6' 2 "" tall.

So my question is, how low should I drop my weight on this cut? The only other time I cut before was in 2008. I ate 20 grams a carbs per day for 5 months (instead of the two weeks recommended in the Atkins diet book), which dropped my weight to 173 lbs. I looked like a skeleton and it took me 4 years to get back to 200 lbs.

I've been reading the wiki and other posts and wanted to get some input from the community. 

My question: What weight lifting/workout routine should I be following to not lose my gains as I train for a half marathon and cut the fat I gained while bulking. 

I workout 5-6 times per week. Once per day. About 1.5 hours per workout. I'm 163 pounds. Male. Skinny fat.

Spent the last 4 months strength training and gained quite a bit of strength. Overall strength progression was in line with my goal but I gained a bit of fat (as expected). 

I'm still skinny fat, but the half marathon is coming up in two months and don't want to lose the strength I gained. Then pick back up after the half with heavy lifting. 

Change of food for half:

* Protein intake: I try to get over 100 grams a day. Need to talk protein shakes to help. (a lot of vegetarian meals)
* Remove sugar intake like FairLife or Yogurts or foods with high sugar content.
* Replaced some lunches with high protein smoothies (mixed frozen berries, banana, unsweetened almond milk, flax seed, oatmeal, protein powder)
* Made home made protein bars as snacks (fresh almond butter, protein powder, hemp seed, chia seed, dates)
* Salads for lunch with chicken or veggie protein burger

Workout: **This is where I don't know what path to follow.** 

* Before it was heavy lifting for push, pull, legs.
* Now I changed to weighted circuits.

Anyone looking to give tips- here's my journey...

My goal is to do 5k in under 25min to compete in an obstacle race. It's also to lose the last little bit on my stomach and tone my ass again. I do not want abs, but I want flat.   
18 months ago I weighed 165 29yo F 5'7, and now I weigh 146lbs because of jogging, a little yoga, and pull ups/pushups/wall sits/squats. And also calorie counting. Before I started my journey I had 0 knowledge on healthy eating or getting fit, and 0 desire to calorie count or work out beyond sports I like. I still am very uneducated and used MyfitnessPal to get most my food info.  


The issue is- I don't actually know what foods to eat and what not too, I'm a pescatarian (only eats fish, no other meat) and I grew up on processed vegi options, and only started learning to cook in the last 5 years since becoming a mom. I still eat a fair amount of processed vegi alternatives and carbs (Pasta and cheese or rice and shrimp, or vegi chow mein). I have been trying to switch to Fish and mashed cauliflowers and steamed carrots for a go to meal. I will stay within my calorie goal (1300 calories)- even if it means I have to work out more (To get an extra 300 calories)- but I know I'm not doing it well- I'm stumbling through it.   


I tried jogging again yesterday for the first time in about 2-3 months and I could only sustain a 3.5 min 5.5km/hr job before my lungs noped out. I do not have any known breathing or health issues.

I put myself on my first diet at age 28 and was able to lose 2+ lbs every week consistently and without much effort. I weighed around 200 and dropped to 182 in a few months with no exercise and a diet that was low on calories, but not exactly healthy. I incorporated 16-8 intermittent fasting but nothing else. No exercise, nothing. I still drank sodas, didn't focus on nutrition, I just kept calories low and intermittent fasted. Not a good, healthy diet, but it helped me lose weight.  


Not surprisingly, after losing the weight I took it for granted and gained it back slowly. As I turned 30 I was back to around 200 lbs. Before the new year of 2020 I finally pushed myself to diet again but this time much better educated and with a permanent plan that included a more healthy diet, regular exercise, strength training and endurance training, tracking my nutrition, drinking more water, visiting the doctor, removing all unhealthy food like sodas, sugars, etc.  


It's only been a month but I've got to say I am really proud of how well I have implemented these changes. I did not grow up in a healthy environment so this type of lifestyle isn't natural for me.  I am running miles again like I haven't since college, I am eating better than ever, my strength is returning fast, and my energy is back to levels it hasn't been for a long time. My body is thanking me in more ways than one. Friends and family who don't know what I am doing have also commented that I look better/thinner, etc.  


The only thing that is a bit disappointing is that I plan to be at my goal weight (168 lbs) by the end of April by losing an average of 2 lbs a week, but I haven't hit that weekly goal a single time even though I did before on my other diet that was not nearly as healthy.  


At first I thought it was simply from the lactic acid build up that I had the first week or two because of hitting the weights for the first time in years, but the soreness is long gone and on weigh in day this morning I only lost 1 lb, the least amount of weight I have lost so far. My body fat percentage also apparently went up, but I don't really believe the measuring device I am using. It's not very consistent.  


Is the lack of weight loss all due to the fact that I am preventing muscle loss through exercise and perhaps putting a little muscle on? Am I going too extreme? (I really don't think I am. I do not feel like I am pushing myself out of my comfort zone, but rather doing something I should have been doing all my life.) Is my metabolism messed up? Or is everything going fine and I should just be happy with around 1 lb per week? I am wondering if I should back off a little, keep going as is, or perhaps step things up a notch to hit my goals.

My question is then, do I absolutely NEED to loose weight all together to shed the fat I have gained in the belly region or will working out on a regular basis 3 times a week while eating healthy eventually get rid of the belly fat?

Thank you in advance."

They're of the opinion that the number of reps matter more because a set number creates a consistency you can follow through on. If you do 60 pushups (as an example) you can always go back to that to ensure your standard is being reached each workout.

I'm of the opinion that the number matters less than the stress you feel during the workout. You don't have to reach 60 as long as the pain/stress on the muscle feels consistent.

I personally don't always hit my reps but I do put an emphasis on extending the motion slower and holding positions for long in an effort to keep the muscles straining and maintaining the full force of the motion. The reason I do this is I always feel like I'm cheating myself if I push through a set because I'm pushing past the part that hurts (which I feel is the part where the benefit comes from)

I was curious what those with a more experienced background in this might think. I'm no expert on this and am simply speaking from what logically makes sense for me. Are both of us flawed to a degree or does one of us have a better idea about how things should be done?

Here's the first post-accident [pic](https://imgur.com/tJFhXDG) after the first surgery. I weighed 68 kg, I know because they needed it for the general anaesthesia.

I have no pics from when I went back because I couldn't bear seeing myself. Life had sucked for over 6 months.

The mirror isn't the best for pics and I think my phone is kicking the bucket but I did my best. Back shots look weird because back pics are hard, I don't have scolliosis I swear lol. They're not the most recent, but they are from december and november.

## Backstory

[Last year's progress.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aawtro/mage_2526bw_5868_kg170_m_1_year_of_powerlifting/)

In late January last year I fell off my bike due to black ice on my way to the gym. I broke both wrists. Ulnar styloid fracture on my left (and I probably tore something because it still bothers me). Transcaphoid perilunate fracture-dislocation at the scaphoid waist with rupture of the scapholunate ligament. It is as bad as it sounds. I wrote about it on a [rant wednesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/alb9q5/rant_wednesday/efdg2jl/), [expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c8bpsu/return_to_runningjogging_after_bad_injury/esmosgh/) on it later. 3 surgeries, permanently reduced ROM and they told me my grip strength would never recover.

Ten weeks after my fall, leukemia took my [dad](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bhhvz1/took_my_dad_on_his_last_ride_this_morning/elu26uf/), I didn't make it home in time. I was two and a half weeks out of my cast but back working on my phd as well as I could. Two weeks later, a friend killed herself. I stopped functioning, all I did was my rehab, cook, eat and sleep. I showered only to meet my supervisors and therapists (physical and psychological).

As soon as I was cleared to lift again, I posted my [victory](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cov0yn/victory_sunday/ewljl3x/) where I talked more about my year.

| Db          | Dumbbell         | Sm          | Sumo         |
| Cv          | Conventional     | Dl          | Deadlift     |
| SS          | Superset         | TM          | Training Max |
| F           | Front            | B           | Back         |
| OHP         | Overhead Press   | RPE         | Rate of Perceived Exertion |
| AxB         | A sets of B reps | AxB+        | A sets of at least B reps |
| Uw Cali     | Unweighted Calisthenics | DUP  | Daily Undulating Periodisation |
| AMRAP       | As many reps as possible | A/B C DEF | B sets at A different percentages at C maximum intensity. W1 at D RPE. W2 at E RPE. W3 at F RPE. |
| W1, W2, Wn  | Week 1, Week 2, Week n   | T1, T2, Tn | Tier 1 (main exercise). Tier 2 (variation of main exercise). Tier n (progressively less important exercise).|

For example:

* 3x5+ @ 70% = `THREE` sets of `FIVE` or more reps at `70%` of the TM for a given exercise.
* 2/3 H MLH = `THREE` sets with `TWO` different percentages of the TM at `HIGH` maximum intensity. W1 is at `MEDIUM` overall RPE for all sets, W2 is at `LOW` overall RPE for all sets, W3 is at `HIGH` overall RPE for all sets.

## Program: nSuns CAP3

I track it with the Zero to Hero app. I rate it because it lets me create custom progressions.

Love this program. It fits with my goals of being strong without the stress of singles, as well as fitting well with the accessories I like. I think it's nSuns' finest work. I like the rep scheme and exercise variety. I like how it manages overall fatigue and depending on how I'm feeling on lighter days I can do speed or paused reps.

I improved the CAP3 spreadsheet so I could also track my accessories and make it a bit more flexible. I expand on this later. I can provide a link to the sheet if people want, I'll just make a trash gmail account.

## Lifts

Here are the progress graphs of my TM since my comeback, raw and normalised to my strength after coming back. These should all be taken with a salt boulder as I do not max out often and they are based of my top set for the day. I can provide the code I used to make these if people want, I'll put them in gists.

| Raw | Normalised |

| [Bench](https://i.imgur.com/n1VKOrb.png) | [Bench Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/9EE5c2B.png) |

| [T2](https://i.imgur.com/Un1U3ky.png) | [T2 Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/RIj5xjV.png) |

A caveat is that I do my rows from the floor and with maximum cheating. Almost like an olympic lift but without hip contact. I like them more and I've found they help build more power than stricter rows.

Interestingly, I didn't really loose that much strength in six months. I went from last year's progress numbers to the y-intercept of this year's non-normalised graphs. Also, if linear gains keep going the way they are my Sm Dl is going to overtake my conventional in about 3 years lol. The graphs also illustrate why I like CAP3 so much, the periodisation gives me a nice break from going heavy and keeps things feeling fresh. However, for OHP I like the LP 6-day progression more than CAP3's.

These are just my top sets in kg (reps x weight) or seconds. F lever I'm on one leg out (shit form), B lever on straddle (ok form), I'm still at l-sit.

| F Lever  |7        | B Lever  |7        | L/V-sit  |13       |

## Diet

I don't get bogged down in the minutia of tracking macros. I don't know how many calories I eat but I make sure I always reach satiation plus a little more, and I make sure I get as close as possible to 2.2 g/kg of lean mass (that's 1 g/lb).

I honestly have quite a healthy diet (thanks ma). I just eat a ton of protein from ground beef, eggs, fresh cheese and whole milk. I always have a generous serving of white rice with it, and sprinkle pre-chopped salad because I don't have time for chopping veggies. I also typically eat fruit, most of them berries because UK, innit. I can count on one hand the number of times I eat out in a year, and I do occasionally treat myself to a phat COOP pizza. I keep dried fruits in my bag for snacks.

My goal right now is to get strong while keeping the top two abs visible in the morning and this works. I also don't have a sweet tooth so the only sucrose I get is from sauces I eat and I don't really use salt for anything. I drink very infrequently and never a lot, I might average however many units are in 1--3 pints of beer a month.

I know my ways are not optimal, big woop. I don't really care, it works for me, I enjoy it, it's sustainable, and keeps me happy and healthy. I've tried using MyFitnessPal and it makes it such a chore. At one point I got obsessive over it and it just made it unenjoyable. I like my routine.

## Supplements

I only take creatine, did a loading phase and now on maintenance. I did notice a pretty immediate difference when I started taking it, and it made me *hella* thirsty. I think it's worth trying out to see if you're a responder or not.

## Lifting goodies

Since my injuries were pretty severe, I bought myself a bunch of shit to heal as best I can.

* **Therapy putty**: I'd recommend this for anyone dealing (and even preventing) wrist, elbow and even shoulder issues (tendonitis, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow). Check out all the exercises you can do with them. There are various different strength ratings. I was given the red (medium) and blue (hardest) by my hand therapist but bought yellow (light) and green (hard) as well.
* **Finger extensor bands**: These are elastic bands for finger extensor training, I got the Ironmind ones. They're pretty good, I have hypermobile phalanges so it's harder for me to use them but I was told by my PT that they also help with wrist, elbow and shoulder problems. Cheap and plenty of resistances. I'm cranking out 3 x 20+ on the third progression out of 5.
* **Theraband flexbars**: These are brilliant, I think anyone who grips things on the regular should get some (drivers, lifters, climbers, racket sport players, cyclists, etc). There are so many exercises you can do, and they similarly help prevent and rehab the aforementioned problems.
* **Thick grips**: Slap those bad boys on all your Db work, even works for pressing to simulate axels and circus Dbs.
* **Wrist wraps**: Loaded radial deviation is uncomfortable for me (getting better), like when benching with a wide grip or during the eccentric on a dip. Wrist wraps fix this. I'm even going to start planche training on parallettes. I got SBD flexible wraps discounted through the powerlifting club at my uni.

### Customisation, Accessories, Programming, Rest Periods

The last time I ran CAP3 I found it very hard to progress on OHP and squats. This changed when I ran the 6-day squat version, so I've replaced the CAP3 T1 OHP progression with the T1 OHP progression of the 6-day program. I used to do RDls but after trying Sm Dls on the 6-day LP, I decided to give it a shot and haven't had any trouble improving my squats since. This in stark contrast to routinely failing my last set of squats on W1 while having no trouble nailing the 2+ set on W2. I'm also more flexible when it comes to how I do my sets, for example T1s and T2s at 6 reps or higher I mix up by doing paused or speed reps, depending on what I think I need to work on given the past three weeks. As of late, I've also replaced CAP3's T2 OHP for the OHP accessory progression of the 6-day LP and do strict OHP instead of DBs.

I designed my accessory progressions with a similar philosophy to CAP3, i.e. with DUP and overall fatigue in mind. I looked at the potential for total fatigue in a particular exercise family based on the total RPE for a given main lift. I designed the rep and weight schemes according to what I have seen work for me while incorporating advice from the likes of Jeff Nippard and Athlean X. This way I keep total fatigue relatively constant throughout the three weeks and keep the program feeling fresh.

Typically for accessories that are compound exercises with a large potential for overloading such as pullups, I chose a high intensity progression. For isolation exercises like bicep curls and calf raises I went with a lower intensity but higher volume approach. For exercises with a potential for overloading but a degree of potential injury such as dips, or where the volume for the exercise family was already high such as incline Db bench press I took an intermediate approach.

| Progression | W1             | W2     | W3     |
|-------------|---------------:|-------:|-------:|
| Grip AMRAP  | 4x10+ @ 62.72% | same   | same   |
| Uw Cali     | 3+x10+          | same   | same   |
| 2/3 L LMH   | 1x12+ @ 62.72%, 2+x14+ @ 60.20% | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  |
| 2/3 M LMH   | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   |
| 2/3 H LMH   | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   | 1x4+ @ 79.28%, 2+x6+ @ 75.30%   |

I increase the difficulty of my accessories on a case by case basis.

1. For most accessories, I increase the weight to something around the calculated TM when I can hit the number of prescribed reps +2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*. This is because I've noticed that T1s and T2s that use the same muscles have a noticeable effect on my ability to perform the accessories.
2. For bw accessories, such as dips and pullups, I add 2.5 kg to my high intensity day if I stall for *&gt;3 weeks*, otherwise I do as aforementioned.
3. For Uw Cali accessories which are held for time such as levers and l/v-sits, I move on to the next progression when I can hold on for 15 seconds on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
4. Uw Cali which are repped out, such as dragon flags and toes to bar, I increase the progression when I can hit the number of prescribed reps + 2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
5. If I can't progress in a tangible way I do the following:
  1. focus on improving my form,
  2. increase time under tension by slowing my tempo or doing paused reps,
  3. add negatives/easier progressions to my sets for additional volume.

#### Rest &amp; Supersets
* Rest 1 min for light sets. 1--1.5 min for middle sets. 1.5--3 min for and after heavy sets. Accessories are either light or middle sets in my mind.
* I superset as much as I can without sacrificing recovery on a muscle group. I superset exercises that won't interfere with each other.

#### Grip
* Hold on to the bar. Whether it is deadlifts or any hanging exercise. I hold for as long as I can on the last rep before increasing weight or the last rep before finishing the exercise.
* I try to false grip on all my hanging exercises.
* I double overhand as many sets of deadlifts and rows as I can.
* I use fat grips on as many Db exercises as I can. This includes all curls, side raises, and as many lunges and split squats as I can manage. When my grip fatigues I take them off and continue with the set (grip drop set). I don't use them for the Db crushes because it leaves no real estate for my fingers to curl and Kroc rows are too heavy. I also use them to do fat grip deadlifts as a warm up.
* I train my finger extensors at work on the days I do Db crushes, same number of sets and reps as I got on crushes.
* I do [FitnesFAQ's wrist routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1-NA9V6ko) every day, even though the ROM of my right wrist is shit.
* Theraband flex bars when my wrists or elbows feel like they might get angry at me.

#### Accessory break-down

I might change a progression here and there as I get more data on my performance but this is what I've been doing and it has clearly been working.

### Deload

I've found that deloading every two cycles (7th week) works best for me. I simply do calisthenics or chase the pump™ a few times that week, takes me about 30 min each day.

## Future Plans

I gotta keep it going. Might do a week or two of normal nSuns here and there, but I quite like what I have going on. I do want to start training planches, my wrist doesn't complain too much when I wrap it and do planche leans.",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7645532,public,,self,,,(M/27/1.70m) 6 Month bounce back.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/eulkpz/m27170m_6_month_bounce_back/,all_ads,6.0,"(M/27/1.70m) 6 Month bounce back. # Progress Report August 2019--Jan 2020

## TLDR

Life took a shit on me in 2019. Couldn't lift from late jan 2019 to early august 2019. Here's what happened to my TM since then. Also, all numbers are on SI because freedom units suck. The tables and links have most of the info, the text is extra info/explanation.

Here's the first post-accident [pic](https://imgur.com/tJFhXDG) after the first surgery. I weighed 68 kg, I know because they needed it for the general anaesthesia.

I have no pics from when I went back because I couldn't bear seeing myself. Life had sucked for over 6 months.

The mirror isn't the best for pics and I think my phone is kicking the bucket but I did my best. Back shots look weird because back pics are hard, I don't have scolliosis I swear lol. They're not the most recent, but they are from december and november.

## Backstory

[Last year's progress.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aawtro/mage_2526bw_5868_kg170_m_1_year_of_powerlifting/)

In late January last year I fell off my bike due to black ice on my way to the gym. I broke both wrists. Ulnar styloid fracture on my left (and I probably tore something because it still bothers me). Transcaphoid perilunate fracture-dislocation at the scaphoid waist with rupture of the scapholunate ligament. It is as bad as it sounds. I wrote about it on a [rant wednesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/alb9q5/rant_wednesday/efdg2jl/), [expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c8bpsu/return_to_runningjogging_after_bad_injury/esmosgh/) on it later. 3 surgeries, permanently reduced ROM and they told me my grip strength would never recover.

Ten weeks after my fall, leukemia took my [dad](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bhhvz1/took_my_dad_on_his_last_ride_this_morning/elu26uf/), I didn't make it home in time. I was two and a half weeks out of my cast but back working on my phd as well as I could. Two weeks later, a friend killed herself. I stopped functioning, all I did was my rehab, cook, eat and sleep. I showered only to meet my supervisors and therapists (physical and psychological).

As soon as I was cleared to lift again, I posted my [victory](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cov0yn/victory_sunday/ewljl3x/) where I talked more about my year.

* 3x5+ @ 70% = `THREE` sets of `FIVE` or more reps at `70%` of the TM for a given exercise.
* 2/3 H MLH = `THREE` sets with `TWO` different percentages of the TM at `HIGH` maximum intensity. W1 is at `MEDIUM` overall RPE for all sets, W2 is at `LOW` overall RPE for all sets, W3 is at `HIGH` overall RPE for all sets.

## Program: nSuns CAP3

I track it with the Zero to Hero app. I rate it because it lets me create custom progressions.

Love this program. It fits with my goals of being strong without the stress of singles, as well as fitting well with the accessories I like. I think it's nSuns' finest work. I like the rep scheme and exercise variety. I like how it manages overall fatigue and depending on how I'm feeling on lighter days I can do speed or paused reps.

I improved the CAP3 spreadsheet so I could also track my accessories and make it a bit more flexible. I expand on this later. I can provide a link to the sheet if people want, I'll just make a trash gmail account.

## Lifts

Here are the progress graphs of my TM since my comeback, raw and normalised to my strength after coming back. These should all be taken with a salt boulder as I do not max out often and they are based of my top set for the day. I can provide the code I used to make these if people want, I'll put them in gists.

| [T2](https://i.imgur.com/Un1U3ky.png) | [T2 Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/RIj5xjV.png) |

A caveat is that I do my rows from the floor and with maximum cheating. Almost like an olympic lift but without hip contact. I like them more and I've found they help build more power than stricter rows.

Interestingly, I didn't really loose that much strength in six months. I went from last year's progress numbers to the y-intercept of this year's non-normalised graphs. Also, if linear gains keep going the way they are my Sm Dl is going to overtake my conventional in about 3 years lol. The graphs also illustrate why I like CAP3 so much, the periodisation gives me a nice break from going heavy and keeps things feeling fresh. However, for OHP I like the LP 6-day progression more than CAP3's.

These are just my top sets in kg (reps x weight) or seconds. F lever I'm on one leg out (shit form), B lever on straddle (ok form), I'm still at l-sit.

| F Lever  |7        | B Lever  |7        | L/V-sit  |13       |

## Diet

I don't get bogged down in the minutia of tracking macros. I don't know how many calories I eat but I make sure I always reach satiation plus a little more, and I make sure I get as close as possible to 2.2 g/kg of lean mass (that's 1 g/lb).

I honestly have quite a healthy diet (thanks ma). I just eat a ton of protein from ground beef, eggs, fresh cheese and whole milk. I always have a generous serving of white rice with it, and sprinkle pre-chopped salad because I don't have time for chopping veggies. I also typically eat fruit, most of them berries because UK, innit. I can count on one hand the number of times I eat out in a year, and I do occasionally treat myself to a phat COOP pizza. I keep dried fruits in my bag for snacks.

My goal right now is to get strong while keeping the top two abs visible in the morning and this works. I also don't have a sweet tooth so the only sucrose I get is from sauces I eat and I don't really use salt for anything. I drink very infrequently and never a lot, I might average however many units are in 1--3 pints of beer a month.

I know my ways are not optimal, big woop. I don't really care, it works for me, I enjoy it, it's sustainable, and keeps me happy and healthy. I've tried using MyFitnessPal and it makes it such a chore. At one point I got obsessive over it and it just made it unenjoyable. I like my routine.

## Supplements

I only take creatine, did a loading phase and now on maintenance. I did notice a pretty immediate difference when I started taking it, and it made me *hella* thirsty. I think it's worth trying out to see if you're a responder or not.

## Lifting goodies

Since my injuries were pretty severe, I bought myself a bunch of shit to heal as best I can.

* **Therapy putty**: I'd recommend this for anyone dealing (and even preventing) wrist, elbow and even shoulder issues (tendonitis, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow). Check out all the exercises you can do with them. There are various different strength ratings. I was given the red (medium) and blue (hardest) by my hand therapist but bought yellow (light) and green (hard) as well.
* **Finger extensor bands**: These are elastic bands for finger extensor training, I got the Ironmind ones. They're pretty good, I have hypermobile phalanges so it's harder for me to use them but I was told by my PT that they also help with wrist, elbow and shoulder problems. Cheap and plenty of resistances. I'm cranking out 3 x 20+ on the third progression out of 5.
* **Theraband flexbars**: These are brilliant, I think anyone who grips things on the regular should get some (drivers, lifters, climbers, racket sport players, cyclists, etc). There are so many exercises you can do, and they similarly help prevent and rehab the aforementioned problems.
* **Thick grips**: Slap those bad boys on all your Db work, even works for pressing to simulate axels and circus Dbs.
* **Wrist wraps**: Loaded radial deviation is uncomfortable for me (getting better), like when benching with a wide grip or during the eccentric on a dip. Wrist wraps fix this. I'm even going to start planche training on parallettes. I got SBD flexible wraps discounted through the powerlifting club at my uni.

### Customisation, Accessories, Programming, Rest Periods

The last time I ran CAP3 I found it very hard to progress on OHP and squats. This changed when I ran the 6-day squat version, so I've replaced the CAP3 T1 OHP progression with the T1 OHP progression of the 6-day program. I used to do RDls but after trying Sm Dls on the 6-day LP, I decided to give it a shot and haven't had any trouble improving my squats since. This in stark contrast to routinely failing my last set of squats on W1 while having no trouble nailing the 2+ set on W2. I'm also more flexible when it comes to how I do my sets, for example T1s and T2s at 6 reps or higher I mix up by doing paused or speed reps, depending on what I think I need to work on given the past three weeks. As of late, I've also replaced CAP3's T2 OHP for the OHP accessory progression of the 6-day LP and do strict OHP instead of DBs.

I designed my accessory progressions with a similar philosophy to CAP3, i.e. with DUP and overall fatigue in mind. I looked at the potential for total fatigue in a particular exercise family based on the total RPE for a given main lift. I designed the rep and weight schemes according to what I have seen work for me while incorporating advice from the likes of Jeff Nippard and Athlean X. This way I keep total fatigue relatively constant throughout the three weeks and keep the program feeling fresh.

Typically for accessories that are compound exercises with a large potential for overloading such as pullups, I chose a high intensity progression. For isolation exercises like bicep curls and calf raises I went with a lower intensity but higher volume approach. For exercises with a potential for overloading but a degree of potential injury such as dips, or where the volume for the exercise family was already high such as incline Db bench press I took an intermediate approach.

| Progression | W1             | W2     | W3     |
|-------------|---------------:|-------:|-------:|
| Grip AMRAP  | 4x10+ @ 62.72% | same   | same   |
| Uw Cali     | 3+x10+          | same   | same   |
| 2/3 L LMH   | 1x12+ @ 62.72%, 2+x14+ @ 60.20% | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  |
| 2/3 M LMH   | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   |
| 2/3 H LMH   | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   | 1x4+ @ 79.28%, 2+x6+ @ 75.30%   |

I increase the difficulty of my accessories on a case by case basis.

1. For most accessories, I increase the weight to something around the calculated TM when I can hit the number of prescribed reps +2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*. This is because I've noticed that T1s and T2s that use the same muscles have a noticeable effect on my ability to perform the accessories.
2. For bw accessories, such as dips and pullups, I add 2.5 kg to my high intensity day if I stall for *&gt;3 weeks*, otherwise I do as aforementioned.
3. For Uw Cali accessories which are held for time such as levers and l/v-sits, I move on to the next progression when I can hold on for 15 seconds on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
4. Uw Cali which are repped out, such as dragon flags and toes to bar, I increase the progression when I can hit the number of prescribed reps + 2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
5. If I can't progress in a tangible way I do the following:
  1. focus on improving my form,
  2. increase time under tension by slowing my tempo or doing paused reps,
  3. add negatives/easier progressions to my sets for additional volume.

#### Rest &amp; Supersets
* Rest 1 min for light sets. 1--1.5 min for middle sets. 1.5--3 min for and after heavy sets. Accessories are either light or middle sets in my mind.
* I superset as much as I can without sacrificing recovery on a muscle group. I superset exercises that won't interfere with each other.

#### Grip
* Hold on to the bar. Whether it is deadlifts or any hanging exercise. I hold for as long as I can on the last rep before increasing weight or the last rep before finishing the exercise.
* I try to false grip on all my hanging exercises.
* I double overhand as many sets of deadlifts and rows as I can.
* I use fat grips on as many Db exercises as I can. This includes all curls, side raises, and as many lunges and split squats as I can manage. When my grip fatigues I take them off and continue with the set (grip drop set). I don't use them for the Db crushes because it leaves no real estate for my fingers to curl and Kroc rows are too heavy. I also use them to do fat grip deadlifts as a warm up.
* I train my finger extensors at work on the days I do Db crushes, same number of sets and reps as I got on crushes.
* I do [FitnesFAQ's wrist routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1-NA9V6ko) every day, even though the ROM of my right wrist is shit.
* Theraband flex bars when my wrists or elbows feel like they might get angry at me.

#### Accessory break-down

I might change a progression here and there as I get more data on my performance but this is what I've been doing and it has clearly been working.

### Deload

I've found that deloading every two cycles (7th week) works best for me. I simply do calisthenics or chase the pump™ a few times that week, takes me about 30 min each day.

## Future Plans

I gotta keep it going. Might do a week or two of normal nSuns here and there, but I quite like what I have going on. I do want to start training planches, my wrist doesn't complain too much when I wrap it and do planche leans."

Life took a shit on me in 2019. Couldn't lift from late jan 2019 to early august 2019. Here's what happened to my TM since then. Also, all numbers are on SI because freedom units suck. The tables and links have most of the info, the text is extra info/explanation.

Here's the first post-accident [pic](https://imgur.com/tJFhXDG) after the first surgery. I weighed 68 kg, I know because they needed it for the general anaesthesia.

I have no pics from when I went back because I couldn't bear seeing myself. Life had sucked for over 6 months.

The mirror isn't the best for pics and I think my phone is kicking the bucket but I did my best. Back shots look weird because back pics are hard, I don't have scolliosis I swear lol. They're not the most recent, but they are from december and november.

As long as I can see my top two abs in the morning, we're good baby.

## Backstory

[Last year's progress.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aawtro/mage_2526bw_5868_kg170_m_1_year_of_powerlifting/)

In late January last year I fell off my bike due to black ice on my way to the gym. I broke both wrists. Ulnar styloid fracture on my left (and I probably tore something because it still bothers me). Transcaphoid perilunate fracture-dislocation at the scaphoid waist with rupture of the scapholunate ligament. It is as bad as it sounds. I wrote about it on a [rant wednesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/alb9q5/rant_wednesday/efdg2jl/), [expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c8bpsu/return_to_runningjogging_after_bad_injury/esmosgh/) on it later. 3 surgeries, permanently reduced ROM and they told me my grip strength would never recover.

Ten weeks after my fall, leukemia took my [dad](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bhhvz1/took_my_dad_on_his_last_ride_this_morning/elu26uf/), I didn't make it home in time. I was two and a half weeks out of my cast but back working on my phd as well as I could. Two weeks later, a friend killed herself. I stopped functioning, all I did was my rehab, cook, eat and sleep. I showered only to meet my supervisors and therapists (physical and psychological).

As soon as I was cleared to lift again, I posted my [victory](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cov0yn/victory_sunday/ewljl3x/) where I talked more about my year.

| AMRAP       | As many reps as possible | A/B C DEF | B sets at A different percentages at C maximum intensity. W1 at D RPE. W2 at E RPE. W3 at F RPE. |
| W1, W2, Wn  | Week 1, Week 2, Week n   | T1, T2, Tn | Tier 1 (main exercise). Tier 2 (variation of main exercise). Tier n (progressively less important exercise).|

For example:

* 3x5+ @ 70% = `THREE` sets of `FIVE` or more reps at `70%` of the TM for a given exercise.
* 2/3 H MLH = `THREE` sets with `TWO` different percentages of the TM at `HIGH` maximum intensity. W1 is at `MEDIUM` overall RPE for all sets, W2 is at `LOW` overall RPE for all sets, W3 is at `HIGH` overall RPE for all sets.

## Program: nSuns CAP3

I track it with the Zero to Hero app. I rate it because it lets me create custom progressions.

Love this program. It fits with my goals of being strong without the stress of singles, as well as fitting well with the accessories I like. I think it's nSuns' finest work. I like the rep scheme and exercise variety. I like how it manages overall fatigue and depending on how I'm feeling on lighter days I can do speed or paused reps.

I improved the CAP3 spreadsheet so I could also track my accessories and make it a bit more flexible. I expand on this later. I can provide a link to the sheet if people want, I'll just make a trash gmail account.

## Lifts

Here are the progress graphs of my TM since my comeback, raw and normalised to my strength after coming back. These should all be taken with a salt boulder as I do not max out often and they are based of my top set for the day. I can provide the code I used to make these if people want, I'll put them in gists.

A caveat is that I do my rows from the floor and with maximum cheating. Almost like an olympic lift but without hip contact. I like them more and I've found they help build more power than stricter rows.

Interestingly, I didn't really loose that much strength in six months. I went from last year's progress numbers to the y-intercept of this year's non-normalised graphs. Also, if linear gains keep going the way they are my Sm Dl is going to overtake my conventional in about 3 years lol. The graphs also illustrate why I like CAP3 so much, the periodisation gives me a nice break from going heavy and keeps things feeling fresh. However, for OHP I like the LP 6-day progression more than CAP3's.

These are just my top sets in kg (reps x weight) or seconds. F lever I'm on one leg out (shit form), B lever on straddle (ok form), I'm still at l-sit.

## Diet

I don't get bogged down in the minutia of tracking macros. I don't know how many calories I eat but I make sure I always reach satiation plus a little more, and I make sure I get as close as possible to 2.2 g/kg of lean mass (that's 1 g/lb).

I honestly have quite a healthy diet (thanks ma). I just eat a ton of protein from ground beef, eggs, fresh cheese and whole milk. I always have a generous serving of white rice with it, and sprinkle pre-chopped salad because I don't have time for chopping veggies. I also typically eat fruit, most of them berries because UK, innit. I can count on one hand the number of times I eat out in a year, and I do occasionally treat myself to a phat COOP pizza. I keep dried fruits in my bag for snacks.

My goal right now is to get strong while keeping the top two abs visible in the morning and this works. I also don't have a sweet tooth so the only sucrose I get is from sauces I eat and I don't really use salt for anything. I drink very infrequently and never a lot, I might average however many units are in 1--3 pints of beer a month.

I know my ways are not optimal, big woop. I don't really care, it works for me, I enjoy it, it's sustainable, and keeps me happy and healthy. I've tried using MyFitnessPal and it makes it such a chore. At one point I got obsessive over it and it just made it unenjoyable. I like my routine.

## Supplements

I only take creatine, did a loading phase and now on maintenance. I did notice a pretty immediate difference when I started taking it, and it made me *hella* thirsty. I think it's worth trying out to see if you're a responder or not.

## Lifting goodies

Since my injuries were pretty severe, I bought myself a bunch of shit to heal as best I can.

* **Therapy putty**: I'd recommend this for anyone dealing (and even preventing) wrist, elbow and even shoulder issues (tendonitis, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow). Check out all the exercises you can do with them. There are various different strength ratings. I was given the red (medium) and blue (hardest) by my hand therapist but bought yellow (light) and green (hard) as well.
* **Finger extensor bands**: These are elastic bands for finger extensor training, I got the Ironmind ones. They're pretty good, I have hypermobile phalanges so it's harder for me to use them but I was told by my PT that they also help with wrist, elbow and shoulder problems. Cheap and plenty of resistances. I'm cranking out 3 x 20+ on the third progression out of 5.
* **Theraband flexbars**: These are brilliant, I think anyone who grips things on the regular should get some (drivers, lifters, climbers, racket sport players, cyclists, etc). There are so many exercises you can do, and they similarly help prevent and rehab the aforementioned problems.
* **Thick grips**: Slap those bad boys on all your Db work, even works for pressing to simulate axels and circus Dbs.
* **Wrist wraps**: Loaded radial deviation is uncomfortable for me (getting better), like when benching with a wide grip or during the eccentric on a dip. Wrist wraps fix this. I'm even going to start planche training on parallettes. I got SBD flexible wraps discounted through the powerlifting club at my uni.

### Customisation, Accessories, Programming, Rest Periods

The last time I ran CAP3 I found it very hard to progress on OHP and squats. This changed when I ran the 6-day squat version, so I've replaced the CAP3 T1 OHP progression with the T1 OHP progression of the 6-day program. I used to do RDls but after trying Sm Dls on the 6-day LP, I decided to give it a shot and haven't had any trouble improving my squats since. This in stark contrast to routinely failing my last set of squats on W1 while having no trouble nailing the 2+ set on W2. I'm also more flexible when it comes to how I do my sets, for example T1s and T2s at 6 reps or higher I mix up by doing paused or speed reps, depending on what I think I need to work on given the past three weeks. As of late, I've also replaced CAP3's T2 OHP for the OHP accessory progression of the 6-day LP and do strict OHP instead of DBs.

I designed my accessory progressions with a similar philosophy to CAP3, i.e. with DUP and overall fatigue in mind. I looked at the potential for total fatigue in a particular exercise family based on the total RPE for a given main lift. I designed the rep and weight schemes according to what I have seen work for me while incorporating advice from the likes of Jeff Nippard and Athlean X. This way I keep total fatigue relatively constant throughout the three weeks and keep the program feeling fresh.

Typically for accessories that are compound exercises with a large potential for overloading such as pullups, I chose a high intensity progression. For isolation exercises like bicep curls and calf raises I went with a lower intensity but higher volume approach. For exercises with a potential for overloading but a degree of potential injury such as dips, or where the volume for the exercise family was already high such as incline Db bench press I took an intermediate approach.

| Progression | W1             | W2     | W3     |
|-------------|---------------:|-------:|-------:|
| Grip AMRAP  | 4x10+ @ 62.72% | same   | same   |
| Uw Cali     | 3+x10+          | same   | same   |
| 2/3 L LMH   | 1x12+ @ 62.72%, 2+x14+ @ 60.20% | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  |
| 2/3 M LMH   | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   |
| 2/3 H LMH   | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   | 1x4+ @ 79.28%, 2+x6+ @ 75.30%   |

I increase the difficulty of my accessories on a case by case basis.

1. For most accessories, I increase the weight to something around the calculated TM when I can hit the number of prescribed reps +2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*. This is because I've noticed that T1s and T2s that use the same muscles have a noticeable effect on my ability to perform the accessories.
2. For bw accessories, such as dips and pullups, I add 2.5 kg to my high intensity day if I stall for *&gt;3 weeks*, otherwise I do as aforementioned.
3. For Uw Cali accessories which are held for time such as levers and l/v-sits, I move on to the next progression when I can hold on for 15 seconds on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
4. Uw Cali which are repped out, such as dragon flags and toes to bar, I increase the progression when I can hit the number of prescribed reps + 2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
5. If I can't progress in a tangible way I do the following:
  1. focus on improving my form,
  2. increase time under tension by slowing my tempo or doing paused reps,
  3. add negatives/easier progressions to my sets for additional volume.

#### Rest &amp; Supersets
* Rest 1 min for light sets. 1--1.5 min for middle sets. 1.5--3 min for and after heavy sets. Accessories are either light or middle sets in my mind.
* I superset as much as I can without sacrificing recovery on a muscle group. I superset exercises that won't interfere with each other.

#### Grip
* Hold on to the bar. Whether it is deadlifts or any hanging exercise. I hold for as long as I can on the last rep before increasing weight or the last rep before finishing the exercise.
* I try to false grip on all my hanging exercises.
* I double overhand as many sets of deadlifts and rows as I can.
* I use fat grips on as many Db exercises as I can. This includes all curls, side raises, and as many lunges and split squats as I can manage. When my grip fatigues I take them off and continue with the set (grip drop set). I don't use them for the Db crushes because it leaves no real estate for my fingers to curl and Kroc rows are too heavy. I also use them to do fat grip deadlifts as a warm up.
* I train my finger extensors at work on the days I do Db crushes, same number of sets and reps as I got on crushes.
* I do [FitnesFAQ's wrist routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1-NA9V6ko) every day, even though the ROM of my right wrist is shit.
* Theraband flex bars when my wrists or elbows feel like they might get angry at me.

#### Accessory break-down

I might change a progression here and there as I get more data on my performance but this is what I've been doing and it has clearly been working.

### Deload

I've found that deloading every two cycles (7th week) works best for me. I simply do calisthenics or chase the pump™ a few times that week, takes me about 30 min each day.

## Future Plans

I gotta keep it going. Might do a week or two of normal nSuns here and there, but I quite like what I have going on. I do want to start training planches, my wrist doesn't complain too much when I wrap it and do planche leans.",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7645531,public,,self,,,M/27/1.70m,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/euljyh/m27170m/,all_ads,6.0,"M/27/1.70m # Progress Report August 2019--Jan 2020

## TLDR

Life took a shit on me in 2019. Couldn't lift from late jan 2019 to early august 2019. Here's what happened to my TM since then. Also, all numbers are on SI because freedom units suck. The tables and links have most of the info, the text is extra info/explanation.

Here's the first post-accident [pic](https://imgur.com/tJFhXDG) after the first surgery. I weighed 68 kg, I know because they needed it for the general anaesthesia.

I have no pics from when I went back because I couldn't bear seeing myself. Life had sucked for over 6 months.

The mirror isn't the best for pics and I think my phone is kicking the bucket but I did my best. Back shots look weird because back pics are hard, I don't have scolliosis I swear lol. They're not the most recent, but they are from december and november.

As long as I can see my top two abs in the morning, we're good baby.

## Backstory

[Last year's progress.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aawtro/mage_2526bw_5868_kg170_m_1_year_of_powerlifting/)

In late January last year I fell off my bike due to black ice on my way to the gym. I broke both wrists. Ulnar styloid fracture on my left (and I probably tore something because it still bothers me). Transcaphoid perilunate fracture-dislocation at the scaphoid waist with rupture of the scapholunate ligament. It is as bad as it sounds. I wrote about it on a [rant wednesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/alb9q5/rant_wednesday/efdg2jl/), [expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c8bpsu/return_to_runningjogging_after_bad_injury/esmosgh/) on it later. 3 surgeries, permanently reduced ROM and they told me my grip strength would never recover.

Ten weeks after my fall, leukemia took my [dad](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bhhvz1/took_my_dad_on_his_last_ride_this_morning/elu26uf/), I didn't make it home in time. I was two and a half weeks out of my cast but back working on my phd as well as I could. Two weeks later, a friend killed herself. I stopped functioning, all I did was my rehab, cook, eat and sleep. I showered only to meet my supervisors and therapists (physical and psychological).

As soon as I was cleared to lift again, I posted my [victory](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cov0yn/victory_sunday/ewljl3x/) where I talked more about my year.

## Nomenclature

| Contraction | Meaning          | Contraction | Meaning      |

| Cg          | Close Grip       | Lb          | Low Bar      |
| Db          | Dumbbell         | Sm          | Sumo         |
| Cv          | Conventional     | Dl          | Deadlift     |
| SS          | Superset         | TM          | Training Max |
| F           | Front            | B           | Back         |
| OHP         | Overhead Press   | RPE         | Rate of Perceived Exertion |
| AxB         | A sets of B reps | AxB+        | A sets of at least B reps |
| Uw Cali     | Unweighted Calisthenics | DUP  | Daily Undulating Periodisation |
| AMRAP       | As many reps as possible | A/B C DEF | B sets at A different percentages at C maximum intensity. W1 at D RPE. W2 at E RPE. W3 at F RPE. |
| W1, W2, Wn  | Week 1, Week 2, Week n   | T1, T2, Tn | Tier 1 (main exercise). Tier 2 (variation of main exercise). Tier n (progressively less important exercise).|

For example:

* 3x5+ @ 70% = `THREE` sets of `FIVE` or more reps at `70%` of the TM for a given exercise.
* 2/3 H MLH = `THREE` sets with `TWO` different percentages of the TM at `HIGH` maximum intensity. W1 is at `MEDIUM` overall RPE for all sets, W2 is at `LOW` overall RPE for all sets, W3 is at `HIGH` overall RPE for all sets.

## Program: nSuns CAP3

I track it with the Zero to Hero app. I rate it because it lets me create custom progressions.

Love this program. It fits with my goals of being strong without the stress of singles, as well as fitting well with the accessories I like. I think it's nSuns' finest work. I like the rep scheme and exercise variety. I like how it manages overall fatigue and depending on how I'm feeling on lighter days I can do speed or paused reps.

I improved the CAP3 spreadsheet so I could also track my accessories and make it a bit more flexible. I expand on this later. I can provide a link to the sheet if people want, I'll just make a trash gmail account.

## Lifts

Here are the progress graphs of my TM since my comeback, raw and normalised to my strength after coming back. These should all be taken with a salt boulder as I do not max out often and they are based of my top set for the day. I can provide the code I used to make these if people want, I'll put them in gists.

| Raw | Normalised |
|:-|:-|
| [Squat](https://i.imgur.com/b7PKTPs.png) | [Squat Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/LDTKXP5.png) |
| [Bench](https://i.imgur.com/n1VKOrb.png) | [Bench Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/9EE5c2B.png) |

| [T2](https://i.imgur.com/Un1U3ky.png) | [T2 Normalised](https://i.imgur.com/RIj5xjV.png) |

A caveat is that I do my rows from the floor and with maximum cheating. Almost like an olympic lift but without hip contact. I like them more and I've found they help build more power than stricter rows.

Interestingly, I didn't really loose that much strength in six months. I went from last year's progress numbers to the y-intercept of this year's non-normalised graphs. Also, if linear gains keep going the way they are my Sm Dl is going to overtake my conventional in about 3 years lol. The graphs also illustrate why I like CAP3 so much, the periodisation gives me a nice break from going heavy and keeps things feeling fresh. However, for OHP I like the LP 6-day progression more than CAP3's.

These are just my top sets in kg (reps x weight) or seconds. F lever I'm on one leg out (shit form), B lever on straddle (ok form), I'm still at l-sit.

## Diet

I don't get bogged down in the minutia of tracking macros. I don't know how many calories I eat but I make sure I always reach satiation plus a little more, and I make sure I get as close as possible to 2.2 g/kg of lean mass (that's 1 g/lb).

I honestly have quite a healthy diet (thanks ma). I just eat a ton of protein from ground beef, eggs, fresh cheese and whole milk. I always have a generous serving of white rice with it, and sprinkle pre-chopped salad because I don't have time for chopping veggies. I also typically eat fruit, most of them berries because UK, innit. I can count on one hand the number of times I eat out in a year, and I do occasionally treat myself to a phat COOP pizza. I keep dried fruits in my bag for snacks.

My goal right now is to get strong while keeping the top two abs visible in the morning and this works. I also don't have a sweet tooth so the only sucrose I get is from sauces I eat and I don't really use salt for anything. I drink very infrequently and never a lot, I might average however many units are in 1--3 pints of beer a month.

I know my ways are not optimal, big woop. I don't really care, it works for me, I enjoy it, it's sustainable, and keeps me happy and healthy. I've tried using MyFitnessPal and it makes it such a chore. At one point I got obsessive over it and it just made it unenjoyable. I like my routine.

## Supplements

I only take creatine, did a loading phase and now on maintenance. I did notice a pretty immediate difference when I started taking it, and it made me *hella* thirsty. I think it's worth trying out to see if you're a responder or not.

## Lifting goodies

Since my injuries were pretty severe, I bought myself a bunch of shit to heal as best I can.

* **Therapy putty**: I'd recommend this for anyone dealing (and even preventing) wrist, elbow and even shoulder issues (tendonitis, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow). Check out all the exercises you can do with them. There are various different strength ratings. I was given the red (medium) and blue (hardest) by my hand therapist but bought yellow (light) and green (hard) as well.
* **Finger extensor bands**: These are elastic bands for finger extensor training, I got the Ironmind ones. They're pretty good, I have hypermobile phalanges so it's harder for me to use them but I was told by my PT that they also help with wrist, elbow and shoulder problems. Cheap and plenty of resistances. I'm cranking out 3 x 20+ on the third progression out of 5.
* **Theraband flexbars**: These are brilliant, I think anyone who grips things on the regular should get some (drivers, lifters, climbers, racket sport players, cyclists, etc). There are so many exercises you can do, and they similarly help prevent and rehab the aforementioned problems.
* **Thick grips**: Slap those bad boys on all your Db work, even works for pressing to simulate axels and circus Dbs.
* **Wrist wraps**: Loaded radial deviation is uncomfortable for me (getting better), like when benching with a wide grip or during the eccentric on a dip. Wrist wraps fix this. I'm even going to start planche training on parallettes. I got SBD flexible wraps discounted through the powerlifting club at my uni.

### Customisation, Accessories, Programming, Rest Periods

The last time I ran CAP3 I found it very hard to progress on OHP and squats. This changed when I ran the 6-day squat version, so I've replaced the CAP3 T1 OHP progression with the T1 OHP progression of the 6-day program. I used to do RDls but after trying Sm Dls on the 6-day LP, I decided to give it a shot and haven't had any trouble improving my squats since. This in stark contrast to routinely failing my last set of squats on W1 while having no trouble nailing the 2+ set on W2. I'm also more flexible when it comes to how I do my sets, for example T1s and T2s at 6 reps or higher I mix up by doing paused or speed reps, depending on what I think I need to work on given the past three weeks. As of late, I've also replaced CAP3's T2 OHP for the OHP accessory progression of the 6-day LP and do strict OHP instead of DBs.

I designed my accessory progressions with a similar philosophy to CAP3, i.e. with DUP and overall fatigue in mind. I looked at the potential for total fatigue in a particular exercise family based on the total RPE for a given main lift. I designed the rep and weight schemes according to what I have seen work for me while incorporating advice from the likes of Jeff Nippard and Athlean X. This way I keep total fatigue relatively constant throughout the three weeks and keep the program feeling fresh.

Typically for accessories that are compound exercises with a large potential for overloading such as pullups, I chose a high intensity progression. For isolation exercises like bicep curls and calf raises I went with a lower intensity but higher volume approach. For exercises with a potential for overloading but a degree of potential injury such as dips, or where the volume for the exercise family was already high such as incline Db bench press I took an intermediate approach.

| Progression | W1             | W2     | W3     |
|-------------|---------------:|-------:|-------:|
| Grip AMRAP  | 4x10+ @ 62.72% | same   | same   |
| Uw Cali     | 3+x10+          | same   | same   |
| 2/3 L LMH   | 1x12+ @ 62.72%, 2+x14+ @ 60.20% | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  |
| 2/3 M LMH   | 1x10+ @ 66.91%, 2+x12+ @ 62.72% | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   |
| 2/3 H LMH   | 1x8+ @ 71.71%, 2+x10+ @ 66.91%  | 1x6+ @ 75.30%, 2+x8+ @ 71.71%   | 1x4+ @ 79.28%, 2+x6+ @ 75.30%   |

I increase the difficulty of my accessories on a case by case basis.

1. For most accessories, I increase the weight to something around the calculated TM when I can hit the number of prescribed reps +2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*. This is because I've noticed that T1s and T2s that use the same muscles have a noticeable effect on my ability to perform the accessories.
2. For bw accessories, such as dips and pullups, I add 2.5 kg to my high intensity day if I stall for *&gt;3 weeks*, otherwise I do as aforementioned.
3. For Uw Cali accessories which are held for time such as levers and l/v-sits, I move on to the next progression when I can hold on for 15 seconds on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
4. Uw Cali which are repped out, such as dragon flags and toes to bar, I increase the progression when I can hit the number of prescribed reps + 2 on *every set for the whole 3-week cycle*.
5. If I can't progress in a tangible way I do the following:
  1. focus on improving my form,
  2. increase time under tension by slowing my tempo or doing paused reps,
  3. add negatives/easier progressions to my sets for additional volume.

#### Rest &amp; Supersets
* Rest 1 min for light sets. 1--1.5 min for middle sets. 1.5--3 min for and after heavy sets. Accessories are either light or middle sets in my mind.
* I superset as much as I can without sacrificing recovery on a muscle group. I superset exercises that won't interfere with each other.

#### Grip
* Hold on to the bar. Whether it is deadlifts or any hanging exercise. I hold for as long as I can on the last rep before increasing weight or the last rep before finishing the exercise.
* I try to false grip on all my hanging exercises.
* I double overhand as many sets of deadlifts and rows as I can.
* I use fat grips on as many Db exercises as I can. This includes all curls, side raises, and as many lunges and split squats as I can manage. When my grip fatigues I take them off and continue with the set (grip drop set). I don't use them for the Db crushes because it leaves no real estate for my fingers to curl and Kroc rows are too heavy. I also use them to do fat grip deadlifts as a warm up.
* I train my finger extensors at work on the days I do Db crushes, same number of sets and reps as I got on crushes.
* I do [FitnesFAQ's wrist routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1-NA9V6ko) every day, even though the ROM of my right wrist is shit.
* Theraband flex bars when my wrists or elbows feel like they might get angry at me.

#### Accessory break-down

I might change a progression here and there as I get more data on my performance but this is what I've been doing and it has clearly been working.

### Deload

I've found that deloading every two cycles (7th week) works best for me. I simply do calisthenics or chase the pump™ a few times that week, takes me about 30 min each day.

## Future Plans

I gotta keep it going. Might do a week or two of normal nSuns here and there, but I quite like what I have going on. I do want to start training planches, my wrist doesn't complain too much when I wrap it and do planche leans."

Since the beginning of this month me and my girlfriend are trying to get back in to shape. Last year we lived with a pretty unhealthy lifestyle of fast food and little exercise. When we started on 2 January we weighed:

Me (26y):
196 cm
109,1 kg
26% muscle
30% fat
Goal: -22 kg

Her (25y) :
173 cm
71,4 kg
28,5% muscle
27,5% fat
Goal: -12 kg

We started by calculating our daily kcal intake, using a TDEE calculator. After that we subtracted -500 kcal from our total. Based on 3-5 times excersice per week*, our kcal intakes are:

Me: 3100 - 500 = 2600 kcal
Her: 2400 - 500 = 1900 kcal

*We go to boxing training 2-3 times per week and go weightlifting at least 2 time per week. About 1 hour per session.

Also we decided to eat healthy of course and keep track of what we eat (myfitnesspal), mainly focus on our macro's and aiming for: 30% carbs / 35% fat / 35% protein.

After a month of hard work (with the exception of 2 cheat meals) the results are pretty good for me, but unfortunately not so much for my girlfriend: 
I lost 4,6 kg (+1% muscle, -1,5% fat)
She lost 0,6 kg doing basically the same things I do.  

I realise that it is easier for me to loose weight since I'm bigger, but nonetheless my girlfriends results are quite disappointing for her.

The only things I can come up with that might be relevant :
- at times we both remained slightly  below our kcal goal, so we sometimes didn't use 200-300 kcal
- she finds it harder to drink a lot of water than I do, though it seems unlikely to me that's the main problem here.

We weigh ourselves weekly and she's starting to get really demotivated seeing things work out for me but not for her. I'd like to continue this journey together with her but I'm not sure what the best advice would be for her anymore.

I started working out consistently around the age of 14 and stuck with it until around 19-20. I played football, wrestled, and lifted competitively in HS and consider myself moderately athletic.

After a year of college everything went out the window because I started working overnights on an ambulance. I worked 12 hour shifts typically 5-6 days a week so my diet consisted primarily of fast food and convenience store deli food, and my energy for lifting was long gone. 

3 years later, I’m depressed, I’ve noticed some issues I’d like to resolve, and I’m genuinely ready to get back in the gym. I initially talked myself out of getting back into things because of embarrassment. I look like I’d be strong, and knowing that I’m nowhere near where I used to be was disheartening. I’m passed that now. My next issue was my diet. I felt like working out was pointless if I wasn’t going to eat right. I’ve cut out fast food, all the extra late night snacking (I’m a smoker and I work overnights still so I battle the munchies sometimes), soda, excessive sugar, etc. I’m continuing to make small steps in my diet and getting a better macro distribution rather than just meeting a calorie deficit. 

For the last two months, I’ve worked at Amazon as an unloader. I’m very active for about 5 hours a day, squatting, lifting thousands of boxes that weight up to 60 lb’s, and things like that. Recently I’ve noticed I’m to the point where I feel I have the extra energy to get a workout in after work, though.

When I look at planing a workout, I have to decide if I’m a beginner, intermediate, or advanced typically. Mentally I feel I’m advanced or intermediate at a minimum. Physically I don’t know where to rate myself. I’ve never been a long distance runner, but I’m great at HIIT type movements. 

My question for you is how should I approach this? Should I focus more on cardio and light weight training? Should I do intense weight training and light cardio, or is it too soon for me to start training like that? My goal is simply to lose body fat and gain stamina. I’m not concerned with getting ripped, gaining a ton of muscle, or anything like that right now. I tend to prefer circuits, supersets, or things like that rather than do one set, wait two minutes, do a set, wait two minutes, etc.

Recently I’ve noticed I’m to the point where I feel I have the extra energy to get a workout in after work, though.

When I look at planing a workout, I have to decide if I’m a beginner, intermediate, or advanced typically. Mentally I feel I’m advanced or intermediate at a minimum. Physically I don’t know where to rate myself. I’ve never been a long distance runner, but I’m great at HIIT type movements. 

My question for you is how should I approach this? Should I focus more on cardio and light weight training? Should I do intense weight training and light cardio, or is it too soon for me to start training like that? My goal is simply to lose body fat and gain stamina. I’m not concerned with getting ripped, gaining a ton of muscle, or anything like that right now. I tend to prefer circuits, supersets, or things like that rather than do one set, wait two minutes, do a set, wait two minutes, etc.

Thank you in advance!"

So I want to get into the gym and get stronger (while doing keto). I am not a stranger to working out, but I also don't consider myself anything more than a beginner, maybe a novice?

Whenever I went to the gym (haven't been in years), I did so at the behest of friends and with no goal in mind. I just lifted to lift. Well now at 200lbs and getting noticeably chubbier... my stomach extends past my tiddies (But I am also naturally muscled: 198lbs and 14% body fat according to Navy Tape Test), I thought it best to make a lifestyle change (basically eat junk food). I want to start keto and wait until I get fat adapted before starting working out. 

Looking at workout plans I stumbled on Ivysaur's 4:4:8 plan. And with the new goals (getting stronger, leaner/reducing body fat, improving my abs/core, and getting a bigger butt) I went ahead and amended his plan to suit my needs. 

This is what I came up with:

** intro/things to keep in mind:**

10 minute cardio treadmill/stairs/rows - Muscle specific Dynamic Stretching - Warm up lifts with reps reducing as weight increases (start with bar @ 1x13 and increase weight until last set is the one before working weight) - Working Sets - Static Stretching - REST!

Complete warm up lifts for each new muscle group

To find working weight if you don't know:

Basically a warm up; start with an empty bar and do 1x10. With each completed set, add weight until you're at a weight where the 5th rep is noticeably difficult.

**Primary lifts preferable progress rate:**

Squat/Deadlift - 15lb/week

Bench/Rows - 10lb/week

Overhead Press - 5lb/week

*But sheeet just improve. Don't stress about the numbers* 

**More things to keep in mind:**

10 rep weight = 75% of 5 rep weight. Increase percentage to &lt;90 if you can handle it 

If you hit &gt;10 reps on a AMRAP (as many reps as possible, defined here by 1x999 exercises) set, next week's weight progression should be greater than the previous week's for that exercise. 

If a set is failed, deload to previous successful weight and complete remaining sets. Next workout, start sets with correct weight and deload as previously mentioned if a set is failed until all sets are completed.

If unable to complete all sets of current weight at end of week, next week, go back to previous successful weight and increase set by 1. On the week following, return to failed weight at regular set amount. Repeat until all sets at current weight  are successful.

If neither  plateau breakers are successful, reduce weight progression and repeat plateau breakers until success.

How would u go about calculating that in a routine?

The reason I ask is that I want to make my routine more flexible, right now I'm doing PPL with 5x5 for compound lifts and 3x10 for accessories. I train 4 days a week. Now a lot of times there are specific things I want to do, such as sprinting or bodybuilding but I don't know how to incorporate them into my routine. I don't want to completely change my routine into a sprinter's routine or a bodybuilder's routine but just want to include elements of them into my own routine. Here are some past examples of why I want more flexibility:

* Friend group challenge to sprint in a few weeks to see who is the fastest 
* Upcoming marathon, want to run it for fun with friend so want to include long runs and maybe interval training
* Want to go to basketball/football/\[insert sport here\] game so want to incorporate power exercises such as jumping
* Want to do one of those jungle obstacle courses so want to improve muscle endurance
* Summer coming up, want to do more bodybuilding

None of these require radical routine changes unless I'm super serious about them or want to keep doing them as a pro or something. So yeah, if I include jumping, how will it effect my routine. How do I calculate how many reps and sets of deadlift?/squat? to remove in place of jumping? If I do sprints, how much do I need to reduce leg day exercises? Another thing is that I heard that strength and hypertrophy exercises affect the same muscle type but muscle endurance exercises don't. Does that mean I can add tons of muscle endurance exercises with much effect on recovery? At the end of the day, my question boils down to:

**How do I convert between, in sets and reps, the following exercise types**: strength, hypertrophy, power, muscle endurance, sprints, long runs, etc. and do they even need conversion as in if I add 3x10 jumps or some 300m sprints or 1x25 leg curls, would they effect leg day (they definitely would, right?)?",True,False,,False,0,t5_2qhx4,7643452,public,,self,,,How to convert between different exercises types?,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ety0e7/how_to_convert_between_different_exercises_types/,all_ads,6.0,"How to convert between different exercises types?

So I talked to my doctor's about it and after getting tests it turns out I have a hypothyroidism. Which does quite a few things to me but a few of them make losing weight difficult. Which was the trouble essentially. Now I have started a bit back taking thyroid medication. And I feel a lot better.

Now contrary to popular belief thyroid medication does not make you lose weight. At least not more then 8 pounds. The part that matters is my diet and exercise will actually be effective now.

Now I have been researching works outs and fitness advice and find mostly contradictary information or long exam like pages that never get to the point so I decided to come here for any advice anybody has. I don't need you to be my personal trainer but any help is appreciated.

I understand it depends on what you’re trying to achieve so what I’m trying to achieve is strength and hypertrophy. Tbh I’m more interested in hypertrophy because I want my arms and chest to look good but the way I see it, if I achieve strength first then I would be able to do more pushups in a row which will lead to muscle growth. 

So should I try to do as many sets of 10 throughout the day and then try to increase the number of sets within a session? Right now I’m doing 3 sets when I wake up within a time spam of 15 min while taking a couple of minutes of a break in between (one set -&gt; make bed -&gt; set two -&gt; brush teeth and put contacts on -&gt; set three)
Then I’ll try to do a couple more sets at night before going to bed.

Her mother told me that she does not speak to anyone, does not get angry about anything, does not easy properly and only tries to sleep. She does not reply to my phone calls or messages. 
I am feeling bad that I am unable to help her and also it hurts to hear from her parents who are emotionally broken now. What can I do in such situation? How can I reach her and what might be wrong with her? Is she going to come out of the shock and be normal gradually?"

This is not a post about motivation. There is plenty of that around Reddit, and I found it really helpful.

This is a post about injury prevention, in the form of a list containing some of the things that contributed (IMO) to a lower back injury and insanely tight hammies that threw me off course for over 6 months, an injury that only after many expensive remedial massage and chiropractor visits, tons of stretching, and lots of patience, I am now recovered from.  


The thing is, I didn't injure myself the way I thought I would in the gym. I always thought if I got hurt, it'd be from pushing too much weight and snapping some tendon or something like that. Nope (not in my case at least).

Here goes. Hope anyone might find this helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

/r/ThisOneIsReally 's list of contributing factors leading to my injury and nearly ruining exercise (and lots of other parts of my life):  


1. Not Stretching properly at the end of my workouts
2. Not Stretching properly at the end of my workouts - I'm writing it twice because it's serious stuff. Static stretching, specifically stretching my legs even when it isn't leg day I think was the biggest factor leading to my injury
3. Not wearing enough clothes when leaving the gym - running out of the gym sweaty, wearing t shirt and shorts in the winter just because the gym is only a few blocks from my house. Shit idea. Muscles get all locked up in the cold and stay tight. I think the tightness really contributed to tight hammies, putting extra strain on my lower back
4. Not hydrating properly - shoulda had more water!
5. Over doing it - I was so focused on losing weight and gaining muscle that I probably, in hindsight, was pushing myself too hard for my age and overall level of fitness prior to 2018 (which to be clear, was none). Probably not the biggest contributing factor, but I'm sure it didn't help. It was kick ass setting goals and smashing them though!
6. THIS IS A BIG ONE - Not listening to my body. If I had done this sooner, I might have saved a ton of recovery time. My legs were so tight, it was slightly painful to bend down and pick up the bar. I should have stopped right there and modified my workout, stretched more, gone to an expert, ANYTHING other than just continuing on. There is a huge difference between fatigue (being tired at the end of a set/workout/run) and ""you are injured"" pain.
7. Not modifying my workout from the moment I realised I was injured. - I stupidly thought ""I'll just drop the weight down and keep doing the same things"" NO.

There's probably more, but those are the big ones for me.  


I hope you're still in the gym come May, and well after that. The crowds will die down by March!

This was my 14^th strongman competition, first this year and fifth United States Strongman show.\n\n#Background &amp; Training:\n\nI am a 35 year old boy, 5\'10"", and walk around typically between 210-215. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I finally gave up programming for myself and got a coach, and it was an awesome decision. I think less and have made solid progress.\n\n#Meet Prep:\n\nI\'ve been competing every few months for the last year and a half, and made the rash decision to enter this contest in early November after a disappointing performance at an October contest in Lubbock, TX. The contest was local so travel logistics were easy, but the late entry didn\'t give me a great deal of time to prep.\n\nThankfully this contest was only 4 events and I\'d already been axle pressing in prep for my previous contest, so there were fewer things to sort out from a technical proficiency perspective.\n\nTraining itself was sort of a shitshow. I pulled 600+ from 18"" a few times in the months leading up to the contest, but there would also be days where 500 was stapled to the blocks. Axle pressing was similarly inconsistent, but I hit a lifetime floor-to-overhead PR two weeks out from the show so I felt good. I don\'t get better at stones by training stones, so I practiced them once to confirm I still knew how and that was it.\n\nUntil a few weeks before the contest it was unclear whether there would be enough 198\'s to split out the 198 and 220 class but about 3 weeks out we got confirmation 198 would make by itself. My weight had drifted up to 215 so I stopped eating like an asshole which brought me down to 210ish about a week out of the show.\n\n#Prep-week / Getting There / Weigh-ins, etc.:\n\nOn Monday evening I was 210. I\'d been drinking a little over a gallon of water for the prior few days, and increased that up to two gallons by Wednesday. Through the week I tapered down carbs, sodium and fiber.\n\nWednesday morning I was 203 and thought I was in the clear, but I was also 203 on Thursday morning. So the entirety of my intake on Thursday consisted of a protein shake and two cups of coffee, all of which was put into my body by 11am.\n\nThursday was torture. Thankfully I was very busy with work so the day went by quickly, and by that night I was sub-200. I tend to lose a few pounds overnight so I decided against any of the more drastic measures I\'d been considering like hot baths and diuretics. \n\nFriday morning I was up early and got to the gym right as morning weigh-ins opened. 197.9, so I actually lost .6 lb more than necessary. Either way, I made it. I spent the rest of the day eating, drinking and napping, and was up to 210 by the time I went to bed.\n\nOn Saturday morning, rules were at 9:15 and the contest started at 9:30. There were 4 competitors in the 198 class.\n\n#Event 1: [18"" Deadlift Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLoWVQ3y0pY&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nLike I mentioned above, I\'d pulled 600+ a few times in training, so the plan was to go 585/625 then go for broke at 645-655.\n\nRight as I\'m getting ready to take my first attempt, my coach walks up and says ""585 is going to win this, so pull it and go sit down.""\n\nThe other three guys had all finished up their 3^rd attempts by 565, so I picked up 585 pretty easily for a one-attempt event win.\n\nThere were ~60 competitors with limited space, so to speed things up they ran deadlift and press at the same time, across four platforms. Men pulled first, which helped me a lot. I often struggle with press, and since it\'s usually the first event my nervousness gets compounded. Pulling first let me get the butterflies out on an event that I don\'t struggle as much with.\n\n#Event 2: [Axle Clean &amp; Press Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3R1TYdZo7E&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nThe plan was to go 240/260, then 270-280.\n\nContinuing the trend of not having to do as much as I was prepared to, my opener at 240 was heavier than all but one of the other guys\' third attempts. \n\nOne guy hit 250 as his third, so I did 250 as my second because they\'d explained they\'d break ties by comparing opening weights. I wish I\'d done 260 for the outright win, whether you count this as a win or a tied-for-first, I got another event win.\n\n#Event 3: [Yoke &amp; Duckwalk Medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54sXQNv0FWs&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nI am not good at moving events.\n\nThe yoke was supposed to be 650, but I\'m pretty sure they had it loaded to 535. That\'s good for me since I\'m very bad at it.\n\nI finished in ~24 seconds and the top two guys were both in the 17\'s. Thankfully another guy was in the 30\'s, so I didn\'t get last.\n\n#Event 4: [Atlas Stone over Bar, Max Reps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExLRo4LiHKU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n240 lb stone over a 50"" (maybe 52""?) bar.\n\nI was in first so I went last. The guy who was in second got 5, and another guy had gotten 7. I got 5 in the first 30 seconds, but pushed on to 9 for the event win, and to seal up the overall victory.\n\n#Results:\n\nI won. \n\nI\'ve never been in a position where I was in control of a show the whole time, and to be frank it was sort of underwhelming. What was necessary to win the max events was well below what I could (and wanted) to do, but you don\'t get extra points for winning by a lot.\n\nBut now that I\'m a few days removed from the contest I feel *fucking awesome*. I usually have a bunch of mistakes that I run through in my head - ""If I\'d done this differently points would be different"", etc. None.\n\n#Final Thoughts / Next Steps:\n\nThis was my second contest with my coach and team, and I really like this setup. Strongman is an individual sport, but having the support and guidance of people I know made for a much better result.\n\nWhile the contest itself was semi-underwhelming, the fire inside me has been fully reignited. I was considering taking an extended break from competition, now I\'m fully focused on training for the USS National Championship in Minnesota in June.\n\nu/trebemot will finally be able to pay me back for all of those nights he\'s stayed in my guest room.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I won.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I competed this weekend at the BattleAxe Showdown in Garland, TX. This was my 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; strongman competition, first this year and fifth United States Strongman show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background &amp;amp; Training:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 35 year old boy, 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot;, and walk around typically between 210-215. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago I finally gave up programming for myself and got a coach, and it was an awesome decision. I think less and have made solid progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Meet Prep:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been competing every few months for the last year and a half, and made the rash decision to enter this contest in early November after a disappointing performance at an October contest in Lubbock, TX. The contest was local so travel logistics were easy, but the late entry didn&amp;#39;t give me a great deal of time to prep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully this contest was only 4 events and I&amp;#39;d already been axle pressing in prep for my previous contest, so there were fewer things to sort out from a technical proficiency perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training itself was sort of a shitshow. I pulled 600+ from 18&amp;quot; a few times in the months leading up to the contest, but there would also be days where 500 was stapled to the blocks. Axle pressing was similarly inconsistent, but I hit a lifetime floor-to-overhead PR two weeks out from the show so I felt good. I don&amp;#39;t get better at stones by training stones, so I practiced them once to confirm I still knew how and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until a few weeks before the contest it was unclear whether there would be enough 198&amp;#39;s to split out the 198 and 220 class but about 3 weeks out we got confirmation 198 would make by itself. My weight had drifted up to 215 so I stopped eating like an asshole which brought me down to 210ish about a week out of the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Prep-week / Getting There / Weigh-ins, etc.:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening I was 210. I&amp;#39;d been drinking a little over a gallon of water for the prior few days, and increased that up to two gallons by Wednesday. Through the week I tapered down carbs, sodium and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning I was 203 and thought I was in the clear, but I was also 203 on Thursday morning.

So I'm trying to figure this out. 

How do you all offset your TDEE when accounting for exercise? I have a desk job, get between 7000 and 10000 steps in a day, and do 20 minutes of yoga 3-5 days a week in the mornings, and run 531 (a strength training program). All told I get 5-7 hours of fitness time each week. 

Just to make the numbers easy, lets say my TDEE based on ""sedentary"" is roughly 2700cal/day. I would classify myself as sedentary because I am a computer guy and do sit/stand at a desk all day long. 500cal/day deficit puts me at 2200 cal/day allowance (I'm rounding to make the discussion easier). However I get up from my desk at work a lot, I'm on my feet for 2 hours every morning, and 2-3 hours every evening, and I work on the 16th floor and take the stairs to my office once or twice a day, in addition to the regular walks around the floor to break up the monotony. Is this a sedentary life?

Using apps like FitBit or MyFitnessPal and allowing them to offset these numbers based on activity level it offsets those numbers in a ***very*** positive direction. Based on my typical day of exercise I get between 400 and 600 extra calories from myfitnesspal, or up to 800 extra from fitbit when coupling exercise with my step count.

For those who have used calorie counting as a weight loss tool, do you offset based on activity level? Would you consider my lifestyle to be ""sedentary""? I'm literally melting off weight (6 pounds in the first week), and fucking hungry as all hell all the time when I hit the 2200 cal/day deficit mark without adjusting for exercise.

Last night I made my own veggie patties without a recipe. I generally tend to hate following recipes because there is just too much too them then I mess it up the entire process. But over the years of trying many recipes I have learned how to just make some general stuff which saved me yesterday.

Last week as I was venting about being hungry from changing my diet and finding out foods that I thought were healthy like sweet potatoes should be limited because the calories don't fill me up enough I got some helpful advice about foods to eat to help feel satiated. 

u/Atworksoonlysfwforme mentioned black beans, spinach and rice as a food to fill me up and all I could think about is how frustrating it would be to try to eat beans and spinach with a fork while I'm hungry. I'm essentially a caveman unable to wield silverware properly.

I ended up looking up other low carb vegetables to replace my sweet potatoes and the rice suggestion and found zucchini! I like zucchini so that would be pretty easy. Problem is that there is no protein in the zucchini so I needed the damn beans too. Without protein my stomach will be full but my body will be hungry.

So I decided to cook zucchini, spinach and lots of black beans with a bit of onion garlic and just emulsify the whole thing! It looked like a weird blob but I don't really care how food looks and it tasted awesome. Threw an egg in that bad boy and pan fried it like a burger. I'm not a vegetarian but a good veggie burger is awesome. Also not a fan of imitation meat burgers, I prefer the taste of the spices in a good veggie burger if I am not eating real meat.

Really frustrated right now. Whenever I hit 15% bf, It seems like my body starts burning muscle instead of fat. I see this both through my bathroom scale (which is not super accurate when measuring body fat, I know), but also in the mirror, and I start to lose strength on my lifts.

Can’t imagine what I’m doing wrong. Any insights based on the below?

Stats: 5’11, 160 lbs, 15% bf, male

Workout routine: 5x/week consisting of 15 mins HIIT (5 min warm-up, 10mins of 30s sprints/30s rest) and 60min strength training (push/pull/legs/push/pull). I get ~6 workouts done, 3 sets of 8-10 reps each.
Push day is typically: flat bench press, incline bench press, chest flys, dumbbell bench press, tricep pushdown with flat bar, tricep push down with rope
Pull day is bentover rows, bent over rows with reverse grip, dumbbell rows, weighed pull ups, chin ups, preacher curl, hammer curl
Leg/shoulder day is squats, leg press, front squats, military press, lateral raises and front raises

Nutrition: diet plan followed *religiously*. Total of ~1700 kcal/day. My TDEE is ~2500 kcal/day (calculated online, and measured by Apple Watch).
Lunch is a 10oz stake (top sirloin) and a 12oz protein shake with 2% milk. Dinner is 12oz of chicken breast and 3oz of brown rice, which I cook with 1 tbsp of butter. 
Eating the same thing every day might seem crazy to some, but I don’t mind at all. I really appreciate the routine.
Macros are 209g protein / 80g carbs / 60g fat

What am I doing wrong? Why can’t I get rid of the last bit of stubborn fat?

Thanks for any insights!",True,False,[],False,1,t5_2zswl,50038,public,,self,,,Help cutting - plateau at 15% body fat and can’t get below,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/emi6iy/help_cutting_plateau_at_15_body_fat_and_cant_get/,,,"Help cutting - plateau at 15% body fat and can’t get below Having trouble cutting - can’t get below 15% bf

Really frustrated right now. Whenever I hit 15% bf, It seems like my body starts burning muscle instead of fat. I see this both through my bathroom scale (which is not super accurate when measuring body fat, I know), but also in the mirror, and I start to lose strength on my lifts.

Can’t imagine what I’m doing wrong. Any insights based on the below?

Stats: 5’11, 160 lbs, 15% bf, male

Workout routine: 5x/week consisting of 15 mins HIIT (5 min warm-up, 10mins of 30s sprints/30s rest) and 60min strength training (push/pull/legs/push/pull). I get ~6 workouts done, 3 sets of 8-10 reps each.
Push day is typically: flat bench press, incline bench press, chest flys, dumbbell bench press, tricep pushdown with flat bar, tricep push down with rope
Pull day is bentover rows, bent over rows with reverse grip, dumbbell rows, weighed pull ups, chin ups, preacher curl, hammer curl
Leg/shoulder day is squats, leg press, front squats, military press, lateral raises and front raises

Nutrition: diet plan followed *religiously*. Total of ~1700 kcal/day. My TDEE is ~2500 kcal/day (calculated online, and measured by Apple Watch).
Lunch is a 10oz stake (top sirloin) and a 12oz protein shake with 2% milk. Dinner is 12oz of chicken breast and 3oz of brown rice, which I cook with 1 tbsp of butter. 
Eating the same thing every day might seem crazy to some, but I don’t mind at all. I really appreciate the routine.

I believe since Fitbit records and stores all of this information that they should give us a breakdown like this.


While none of these statistics are astonishing, they are an accomplishment. It also serves as evidence that weight loss begins with DIET.

This year I want to incorporate working out and I’ve gotten a gym membership. Planet fitness is right in my way to work so that’s where I signed up. 

So far I’ve only done cardio because I’m not sure where to begin. With the types of machines they have in mind - can anyone help me with a workout routine? 

Looking for one day chest/shoulders/arms and another back/legs. I’ll be going Monday-Wednesday and Friday in the morning before work. 2 of those will be cardio focused days at first."

39m here, started 2019 with a crossfit trainer that did a decent full body workout where I always got past the ""wall"" (that is, where I work hard enough to get the adrenaline rush that lets me go the rest of the session and generally makes me good the rest of the day). I quickly learned that $200/mo was way too expensive for me (2 classes per week), and so I resigned myself to going to the gym. While I'm pretty good about getting what I think a decent workout is (some resistance training, run for an hour, free weights) I don't ever hit that rush and I never feel like I get a good enough workout without it.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a good gym workout that can really kick my ass? I have about 1.5-2 hours between 10pm and midnight that I can go every day if I have to.

Hey y'all. A little backstory on me. I'm 36 and have been working on and off for a couple of years. Have been getting pretty into it the last six months, going between 4-5 days a week. I feel like I'm at a crossroads in terms of training and don't know where to go from here.

I started with an upper/lower routine. Did that for about 5 months and then started my own routine where i would do Chest/triceps, shoulders/legs, back/biceps. My schedule makes it so i do three days in a row, get one day off, do two days in a row, get one day off and repeat. Also i should mention I have medical issues where i have a hard time digesting food. (not looking for medical advice, just saying that because it hinders my size and recovery). That being said I'm 5'9 and 135 pounds. I was 120 pounds when i started.

My lifting days are as follows. Day 1 Bench 140x6 , weighted dips +27 pounds 6x6. Day 2 Either shoulder press 90 6x5 or dumbell raise 47 pounds 6x6, One legged press 120 6x6. Day 3 weight chins +22.5 pounds 6x6, seated row 120 pounds 3x6, one armed machine cable pull 3x8 at 90 pounds.

Still with me? So as you see I have gained some decent strength. The thing is, I'm having energy issues and feel pretty bogged down lately. Just overall sluggish and cooked in general. Also my lifts are starting to stall. Feeling pretty stuck on bench, ohp and cable row. Would i be considered intermediate at this point? Even after six months? Also do you think this is too much volume? I was thinking about maybe doing a pull/push/legs routine, but lowering the volume so I am only lifting heavy 3x5 on the big lifts and then doing lighter accessories (so like 3x5 on bench and then doing lighter flys). I'm aiming for 12 sets per muscle group a week.

I hope this makes sense and it's a bit of a read but i would love some opinions and see what other people would do in my situation. Thanks a bunch!",True,False,[],False,1,t5_2zswl,48825,public,,self,,,Need help on routine and where to go from here,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/eevvz4/need_help_on_routine_and_where_to_go_from_here/,,,"Need help on routine and where to go from here

It takes care of the calculations of percentages, exercise selection and calorie management. It randomises an upper/lower workout, in a 4 week cycle, in a 12,8,4,1 rep scheme (based off 531). Its only autoregulation I used is a Rated Perceived Effort at the end of a workout to control volume, and progression through AMRAP set based off my 3 rep max. The higher rep scheme is just what I found keeps me from injury.

 I have tried to explain as much as I can, its obviously catered towards my personal use but if there is enough interest I can try to release a copy for anyone to use. Also for some reason it doesnt show pull down menus, most yellow cells have menus or use input. The rest autocompletes.

DB front squat

DB overhead press (palms parallel)

DB deadlift (this is the one I'm not sure about converting to a DB movement)

Planks

DB goblet squats

Don't worry, reddit is not at all the first place I've looked for advice, but I'm hoping someone out there might have experience with a problem that my two personal trainers, two physiotherapists, family doctor, podiatrist, and rheumatologist have failed to identify.

The problem:

Chronic joint pain in knees, elbows, and sometimes feet. I can't put any amount of resistance on my elbows and knees without hurting them. This wasn't an issue until I finally built a habit of going to the gym three times a week. There might be some form issues but my trainers say my form is pretty good and any imperfections should not result in what I experience. At this point, I'm on the verge of giving up exercise.

I've read many people on the sub talk about interesting and similar joint issues. Do you have any thoughts about what it could be? All the professionals I have seen are at a loss, although we continue to investigate. 

Other details:

Personal trainer: Says I'm the worst customer he's ever had; he works with car crash victims who show better improvement. He initially didn't believe me when I told him about my limitations but has since given up and told me this problem is beyond his knowledge and skills.

Physiotherapist: Could not explain the collection of symptoms. She recognized that I had stiffness and limited movement in some areas. She recommended stretches and some light strengthening exercises.

Family Doctor: Did some blood work and identified a white blood cell mutation [HLA-B27] that is linked to auto-immune disorders. Further tests showed I do not have several of the worst illnesses associated with the mutation.

I've made excellent progress, and the benefits have been wonderful: weight loss, muscle development, aesthetic improvements to my physique, and significant improvements to my mental health (e.g. reduced stress, improved mood, etc.). It's just been awesome.

But approximately one month ago, I started feeling some serious pain in my right shoulder. Not exactly sure what caused it --- might have been due to overextending on a pushing exercise (e.g. dumbbell press), but it could have also resulted from weightlifting and cumulative effects of ineffective movements in everyday living (e.g. holding my daughters a certain way, reaching for things, sleeping the wrong way, etc.). I dunno.

Anyway, like any other dumbass-tough-guy, I shrugged off the symptoms and just kept training, doing nothing about it except complaining that prevented me from lifting at my best. Then, predictably, things just got worse and worse, to the point where I could barely complete any exercise connected to the chest or shoulders (except for dips and tricep extensions), and even holding the bar for a back squat became unbearable, due to the extension required.

Eventually, I made an appointment with family doctor, who recommended that I see a physiotherapist. He confirmed my doctor's suspicion: looks like it's a **rotator cuff impingement in the supraspinatus**. It's been about 3 weeks, and while I'm seeing \*some\* improvements, it's been up and down. He's been doing things like deep tissue release, cupping, etc. and having me completely daily exercises to strengthen my rhomboids, rear delts, and lats, as well as stretches to open up the chest and shoulders. I've also had a few massage therapy sessions, which have helped a little bit, but not much. I've also spent the 1.5 weeks doing do heavy weight lifting whatsoever, not even for parts of he body unaffected by the shoulder injury. (I don't want to train only some parts of my body since that might cause imbalances etc.) In the meantime, I've doing moderate yoga and cardio every day (in addition to my prescribed physio exercises), but not much else other than that. I've also been maintaining a good diet overall, but I've noticed myself slipping, mainly due to the effects on my mental health.

Anyway, this has been affecting me a lot more than I thought it would. It's bad enough that I feel demoralized, sad, and pretty much hopeless... I'm really worried that I won't be able to re-establish a regular weightlifting program again. (To say nothing of the losses in the gains I've made over the past year...) And it's not just the physical side of things. It's the impact that it's had on my mental health. I'm already finding myself getting more easily frustrated and destabilized by things that I've been handling well when I was weightlifting regularly. I also like this is a 'first world problem' --- so I feel guilty about how I feel too.

Over 4 months, I reduced my body fat % by 6.7% while maintaining (even increasing slightly) muscle mass. This was done through a 3 day lifting routine, boxing training a couple days a week, and a modest caloric deficit.  The results came, but very slowly. I had some neato before and after DEXA scans though.

# Introduction/Background

&amp;#x200B;

|Gender|Male|
|:-|:-|
|Age|35|
|Boxing Experience|\~1 year|
|Lifting Experience|\~3 years|

*Additional Background Information*: I was in my 30's when I started exercising regularly. At some point I begin lifting more regularly, intentionally bulking and in late 2018 I started regularly going to a boxing gym as well.

In the summer of 2019 I was at my heaviest: \~190-192 lbs (86-87 kg) at a height of 6'0 (1.83 m).  When I saw friends that I had not seen in a while, they complimented me. My tshirts fit well and I looked in shape.  My frame tends to hide weight well so, in spite of the compliments, I suspected that I was less Arnold and more Fat Mac (reference photo: [https://i.redd.it/kua02st4nwd01.jpg](https://i.redd.it/kua02st4nwd01.jpg)).

So, I decided to get a DEXA scan. It confirmed that I was indeed in the 'chunky' medical category - more than I had even suspected. I had a 23.8% body fat percentage. I was kind of shocked, since I had done a slow and clean bulk to minimize how much fat I was putting on.

I graciously accepted my certificate of obesity from the DEXA scan place and decided to get leaner.

&amp;#x200B;

# Goals

My goals were:

* Be less fat.
* Maintain my strength.
* Suck less at boxing.

I also wanted to keep things relatively simple both in my workouts and diet, to help keep me compliant.  Life is hard and I have a stressful job too so I was trying to be realistic.

# Time-frame

I started my cut in July 2019 and my post-cut DEXA scan was taking November of 2019. Therefore this post deals with that 4-month time-frame.

&amp;#x200B;

# Diet

*Calories*: I estimated maintenance at \~2700 calories.  I cut to 2450 and weight came off slowly but consistently.  After a while, weight loss stalled until I cut further to 2200. Once I did do, the weight started dropping again.

*Macros*:  The goal was to get 180 g of protein a day.  I tried to fill the rest with a variety of decent food, but didn't bother tracking fat and carbs as such.

*Typical Day:*  I used an app to track what I ate every day.  A typical day right now is the following:

* *Post-workout*: protein shake (160 calories/30 g protein)
* *Breakfast*: greek or icelandic yogurt (120-150 calories/15 g protein)
* *Lunch*:  Typically one of the following:
   * A 4-6 oz portion of either chicken, turkey or salmon (150-300 calories; between 25-50 g protein), with a vegetable side like ratatouille (150 cal) or broccoli (50 cal), with 1 cup rice (240 calories) or maybe root vegetables
   * A chicken burrito bowl with veggies, beans, etc. (650 cal; 40-45 g protein)
   * A large mixed veg salad with chicken, egg, and low calorie dressing (640 cal; 50-55g protein)
* *Snacks*: Typically one or more of the following options through the day.
   * One or more servings of fruit, e.g. berries or a mandarin orange. If craving something more calorie dense, nuts or dried dates (rare).
   * Raw pumpkin seeds (180 cal / 8 g protein)
   * Beef jerky (125 cal / 15 g protein), Chicken soup (180 cal / 15 g protein) or Tuna (90 cal / 13 g protein)
   * Protein bar (200 cal / 20 g protein) or protein shake (160 calories/30 g protein) if I need help hitting the protein goal
* *Dinner*: Dinner is the wild card, but typically includes a significant protein source that I try to vary (chicken, ground turkey, sardines, eggs, cottage cheese, beans/lentils), with either salad or sauteed veg, and depending on how I am doing during the day some carb (sweet potato, rice, tortillas, protein pasta, rye crisps, etc).

I did not stick to the above all the time. Weekends and work functions are particularly tough.

&amp;#x200B;

# Supplements

Protein I guess? Other than that, I didn't consume anything that wasn't food (creatine, pre-workout, rhino horn, HGH, cocaine, Gnar Pump laced with viagra, etc). This is probably not ideal, but helped me keep things simple. However, I learned I was Vitamin D deficient during an annual checkup recently and will be taking a multivitamin with Vitamin D going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

# Workout Routine

I work out 5-6 days a week in the mornings.  Every week, 3 days of those days consist of the following lifting routine:

*Pull Day* (aka back, trap and biceps day):

* Deadlifts (3 x 5-8 reps)
* Barbell Shrug (4 x 8-12 reps)
* Pull ups and chin ups (5 x 6-12 reps)
* Bicep curls (3 x 8-12 reps)
* Dumbbell row (3 x 8-12 reps)
* Cable row (3 x 8-12 reps)
* Hammer curls (3 x 8-12 reps)

&amp;#x200B;

*Push Day* (aka chest, shoulder and triceps day)

* Benchpress (5 x 5-10 reps)
* OHP (5 x 5-8 reps)
* Dumbbell incline fly (3 x 8-12)
* Tricep Extension (3 x 8-12)
* Cable Face pulls (4 x 15-20)
* Tricep Pulldown (3 x 8-12)

&amp;#x200B;

*Leg Day* (aka leg day, and also whatever else I want to throw in day)

* Barbell lunges (3 x 8-12 for each side)
* Barbell front squat (3 x 8-10)
* RDL (3 x 8-12), or power cleans
* Leg raises or weighted crunches (3 x AMRAP)
* If time allows, I either run at the end (not more than 5k) or do a few rounds of heavy bag work.

&amp;#x200B;

*Boxing*:  The other 2-3 days of my week is boxing.  The boxing training is typically a mix of technical and endurance work, with a sparring session thrown in every now and then. I think of boxing as a mix of HIIT and cardio.

&amp;#x200B;

*Rationale*.  My goal was to hit every muscle group 1x a week to maintain strength, while improving conditioning and technical ability by boxing. I thought that would be reasonable and let me balance my various priorities and time constraints.

&amp;#x200B;

# Results/Before and After Scans

*Cautionary Note*.  From what I can find a DEXA scan is a relatively reliable -- but not perfect -- way to check body comp.  I think are helpful when taken with a grain of salt and when used for identifying trends.

&amp;#x200B;

*Body composition*. Here are my DEXA scan results. [**https://imgur.com/a/JfkNf4H**](https://imgur.com/a/JfkNf4H)**.**  These are my before and after pics so to speak.

This link shows results from the initial measure date from July 2019 and the second measure date of Nov 2019, so you can see progress between those dates.

You can draw your own conclusions from the details but here are the highlights for me:

* Weight went from 188.1 to 175.7, a loss of 12.4 lbs (5.6 kg)
* In spite of the overall weight loss, my lean mass actually went up by 2.4 lb (1 kg)
* My total body fat % went from 23.8% to 17.1%, a drop of 6.7%

*Strength*.  My lifts were generally unchanged from when I started; some might have gone up slightly and some (bench) went down slightly.

Here are the working weights for some of the lifts:

* Deadlifts: 5-8 reps @ 315 lbs
* Barbell Shrug: 10 reps @ 275 lbs
* Benchpress: 10 reps @ 155 or 3-5 reps @ 175 (stop laughing)
* OHP: 5-8 reps @ 115lbs
* Barbell lunge: 12 reps @ 155 lbs
* Barbell front squat: 8-10 reps @ 135 lbs (please stop laughing)
* RDL: 10 reps @ 225 lbs

&amp;#x200B;

*Cardio*.  I do not have a reliable numerical measure for cardio (fitbit says my resting heart rate is 60- who knows if that is accurate), but I feel that my cardiovascular endurance improved significantly. I'd say half of that improvement is as a result of carrying less weight. The other half is boxing training.  My coach likes to say there is 'fit', and then there is 'fighting fit'.  Going a few rounds while someone is trying to take your head off is good encouragement. Then again, he also curses at me and calls me a bum, so who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

*Boxing*: Still suck.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

This is not one of those crazy transformations.  I didn't go from stick figure to Rich Piana (RIP homie) in 2 weeks. I didn't overcome some traumatic break up, lose 150 lbs, or transform from ugly duckling to beautiful swan.

However, I did improve and meet most of my goals. This is the overall best shape I've been in. If I can stay free of injuries, I will feel pretty good as I age.

The fact I was able to cut fat while increasing my lean muscle mass slightly makes me feel like the slow, steady approach,  worked for me. Given my age, keeping up with new fads, new supplements, weird ways to eat and all that malarkey is hard - so knowing that this simple approach works is nice. Also, stay off my lawn.

That said, my progress was *embarrassingly* *slow*. 12.4 lbs over 4 months is pretty damn glacial. This is probably due to some amount of non-compliance with the diet (I like pie and miss bulking). Or, I could have gone more aggressive with my deficit and done a 'true' cut rather than what turned out to be a slow ass recomp.

But I'm not in a rush, so I'll take it. Since it wasn't too mentally draining to do this cut, I also feel better about continuing and trying to hit my next BF goal.

&amp;#x200B;

# Questions and Other Thoughts

* What could have I done better?
* If anyone can help interpret the bone density results that would be appreciated.  Greek to me.
* While I lost abdominal fat, I saw an increase in visceral fat on the DEXA scan. This is somewhat concerning but the numbers are very small (increase of \~3 oz), so not sure what to make of it.

I'm (34M). I'm in good shape, not great. I want to take it to the next level. I'm 6'1"" 190. Mostly lean with a little bit of a gut. Not terrible but not what I want. Love to eat, especially at night. I'm a bit of a hard gainer. Mass isn't something that comes easy for me. Here's a snapshot of my current fitness/diet regimen.

**Exercise:**  
Weight Lifting - 3X per week. Bi/Tri split. Chest/Back split. Legs/Shoulder split (although i usually skip legs). I also warm up with a mile on the treadmill and sometimes add another at the end.

Cardio - 1-2X per week. I either run for 3-4 miles or play basketball for an hour and a half.

Additionally I walk my dog about 1.5-2 miles per day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Diet (Weekdays):**

Breakfast - Wheat english muffin or multigrain toast with avocado/turkey/egg.

Lunch - Usually a salad with tuna/beans/veggies/light Italian dressing

Dinner - Sometimes another salad. Sometimes Protein &amp; Brown Rice (salmon or chicken with sauce)

Post Dinner - Where I struggle. I can snack. Trying to cut sugar out of it and stick to things like Pretzels, Chex Mix, Fruit and Yogurt if I want sweet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had been going without a good protein, but I just recently added in 50 mg of whey every day. So my protein intake is usually between 100-150 grams.

What other steps should I take to go from ""Guy who looks like he works out some"" to ""Physical Specimen""?

I took 3rd place.

&amp;nbsp;

**BACKGROUND**

This would be my second powerlifting meet, and I had a lot of things to work on since that time because I had neglected strength development and conditioning in exchange for a higher total, so I came out of it very detrained, and I came into this meet in a higher weight class.

&amp;nbsp;

**TRAINING**

I don't really follow a program. I did a lot of drop sets with squat, bench, and deadlift, to build my conditioning, and, ran into some issues with recovery after a few months and missed a few progressions as I was trying to avoid using 5lb and 10lb plates. Some of that training can be seen here

&amp;nbsp;

[Deadlift drop set starting at 405x5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLK1Cldw-M&amp;t)

[Squat drop set starting at 315x5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri3Ino-6Txs&amp;t)

&amp;nbsp;

When that avenue of progress was exhausted, I started doing a lot of work in the 10rm range, and I focused on just building a baseline of strength. I would look at what I did the previous week, and just do more than last time, and I work from the heavir weight to a lighter weight. At some point, my 10 rm training total was the same as my 5rm training total, and I had hit [335lbs x 4 for squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN3APIizYPk&amp;t) squats and [355x1 for squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdtEGsdwsxY) in preparation for this meet. After August 22nd came around, I started a new job with 12 hour days and was only able to train every other week. Still, I was gaining strength.

&amp;nbsp;

**THE MEET**

I ended up in a fairly competitive weight class, with 6 lifters in the 93kg class. One actually had signed up about 5 minutes before weigh ins, paid the membership fee for USAPL and the meet entrance fee. It was his first meet so it was interesting to see his picks for attempts. I had everything planned out more or less ahead of time what others were doing didn't influence me too much. Still, having access to the scoreboard in the warm up was a great way of watching the meet while waiting for my turn. I was in flight B and assumed wrongly that I was going to have time to warm up, so I sat back and watched the 74kg men and under as well as the women lift.

&amp;nbsp;

**THE LIFTS: 7/9**

**SQUATS: 152.5kg hit, 157.5kg hit, 165kg miss**

Oh, man. Was I wrong about the whole time to warm up thing. They went right into flight B from flight A, and I was about 4th in line. Everyone was warming up by then and I had no free space or even the time to do. Both the 152.5kg and 157.5kg hits were cold, but they felt solid as heck and so I decided my third attempt I would go for 165kg instead of 162.5kg. I ended up losing balance on the top of the lift and my heels came up, so the spotters just took it. Still, its a 5kg PR so I'm happy.

&amp;nbsp;

**BENCH: 92.5kg hit, 100kg miss, 100kg hit**

Honestly just frustrating here. I really wanted to finish with 105kg, and I was able to open higher than previously as a result of my training, but when I attempted 100kg the second time around my hamstring started tightening and I racked before the command as a result. I was going to just pass the third attempt to avoid injury but I couldn't just leave 7.5kg on the table. tried it again and just made sure I waited for the rack command this time.

**DEADLIFTS: 155kg hit, 170lk hit, 182.5kg hit**

I started off light because I wanted to at least have a score and I was having some issues pulling in training. Mainly, I was having issues pulling 405lbs in training, and then even 375lbs and then even 365lbs. In the meet, I wasn't actually even sure if I had 170kg in me, and I definitely wasn't sure about 182.5kg, but I just went in and ripped the hell out of it, for a 2.5kg PR.

**RESULTS**

[South Side Fall Classic results](https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/competitions-view?id=2657)

[My lifter profile](https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=55690)

I left with a 7.5kg increase to my total, took third place out of 6, and, being right in the middle of this weight class, feel that I probably have a lot of room for growth. Work will continue to be a challenge for training until I can get a home gym, so I'm happy I walked away with anything, honestly. Taking 3rd place in a meet with more than 3 lifters in my class was exhilarating.

Pick openers that will put you on the board. One guy bombed out and his attempts would have put him in first place, and me at 4th.

Pick something you know you can hit any day of the week because you never know when warm ups will just not go the way you want. Perhaps the next greatest feeling besides placing was actually just going out, and hitting the squats without a warm up.

Also, most of my goals would have been, or were, met by the second lift. The third attempts I had saved for PRs and didn't really worry too much if I had hit it or missed.

The moderator team has been working hard over the years trying to ensure quality content is made available to all readers. We've made some changes to fight spam, removed youtube links as examples and it has greatly helped the community grow. It should be noted that besides spam and removing offensive posts/comments the subreddit moderation has been left to the community with their voting power (i.e. up votes and down votes). Recently (\~3 months) the subreddit has had an influx of low effort progress posts that usually have little to no details. To combat this the moderator have decided two things:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Develop progress pic posting rules (similar to the /r/fitness ones). We don't want to demonize the hard work people do, however, should the poster not provide sufficient detail the post will be deleted.  See rules [https://old.reddit.com//r/fitness30plus/wiki/rules](https://old.reddit.com//r/fitness30plus/wiki/rules) 

&amp;#x200B;

2) We will change PR Friday to Victory Friday for people who simply want to post progress pics and receive comments without providing additional details. 

&amp;#x200B;

The moderator team will monitor and see what affect these changes will have. Please note, we are a team of volunteers, and I know for myself don't log into reddit on the weekend (yes i'm old and avoid technology over the weekend), meaning we may not catch them all right off the bat or the exact minute they've been posted.

I got Box VR which is a pretty cool Cardio Kickboxing game that works a bit like Guitar Hero. Instead of playing a guitar it's your basic jab, cross, hook, upper, duck, and parry. The one that REALLY kicked my ass was ""Thrill of the Fight"" which is a flat out boxing game. I didn't realize how much effort I was putting into it because I was getting so into the fights. 

After my first day of playing, I was so sore I could barely move. Laughing or coughing hurt. 

If you haven't tried VR Fitness yet, consider this a very strong endorsement.

I run, bike, lift and do yoga but mostly I consider myself a runner.  I have been running for over 40 years and participating in road races from 5Ks to Marathons for about 35 years and I have learned a bit about life and running during that time.  I am not a physiologically gifted runner, spending most of my time (based on extreme effort) at the backend of the lead group or front of the middle group depending on the race.  However, in the past 10 years I suddenly find myself consistently winning or placing in my age group.  I think I can tell you why.\n\nFirst let me state that the information to follow is based on life experience only. I am not a coach nor do I have any particular training.  I\'ve simply lived for a fairly long time and am still running and competing (which by itself says something). So take what I say with a grain of salt until you can prove it to yourself.\n\nI started taking yoga classes in my mid 50s because, after 20 years of running and moderate lifting I found myself to be extremely inflexible. I did the usual pre and post run stretch\'s (to a limited degree) so I was surprised to find how stiff I was. I could not sit up straight with my legs out in front of me unless I was against a wall.  So yoga seemed like a possible remedy.  Despite being what I would call very fit, the first few classes kicked my butt.  I stuck with it however and, after several months, learned to accept it.  Although progress seemed non existent, the classes started to feel easier.  A year or so later I suddenly noticed some progress. I also started liking yoga even more.  After several years of classes and a moderate increase in flexibility I started a daily home practice.  The more yoga I did, the better I felt. I soon incorporated yin yoga poses into my practice and really progressed from that point (yin poses are passive, you hold the pose for 3-5 minutes and allow gravity to assist you into the pose).\n\nThe real secret to the improvement at that point is that yin yoga stretches connective tissue, not just muscle. Why is that important?  In the book  ""The elements of effort"" John Jerome notes that ""If muscle is the engine, connective tissue is the transmission, differential, suspension system, wheels and tires, the means of getting power to the road.""  Most of the stretches runners do may help loosen the muscle a little but do nothing for the connective tissue that Mr. Jerome feels is so important.\n\nThere are many aspects of aging that cannot be avoided. You will lose muscle mass and your maximum heart rate will decrease (reducing the amount of oxygen you can send to those muscles). As a result you will get slower, hills will get steeper and miles will seem longer. The one factor you can control to some degree is stride length and that will depend on your flexibility. I have been able to maintain my stride length while others have not so I am suddenly winning in my age division, not because I am faster but because lack of flexibility is making others slower.\n\nSo what is my point?  If you are in or approaching your 50s, start stretching now (if you are in your 20s so much the better). Find a good stretching program and stick with it. I do suggest you try yoga but it does not work for everyone so find out what works for you. Make stretching an integral part of your overall fitness program, over time you will learn to love the result.\n\nIn short, true fitness requires flexibility and flexibility makes it so much easier to stay active and fit.\n\nSorry this is so long.

I can't even hold a conversation without nearly falling asleep. My temptation is to go to the gym, but it's occured to me that maybe I'm overdoing it? Or I'm not doing something right. I'm going about 4 days per week.

I do work out fairly hard. I spend 15 min raising my heart rate on a heavy bag or run a mile. Then I spend almost 2 hours lifting, but I don't take breaks... I alternate between exercises to keep my heart rate up. Maybe that's what I'm doing wrong....

I'm eating about 2500 calories a day and I'm not losing a lot of weight so I think it's okay. I'm 175lbs and 5'4"" so I'm not underweight (nor is bring skinny my goal.). I've upped my protein (I did find out that I wasn't getting enough before).  Get between 100 and 150 g of protein per day. I was vegetarian before, but I have found it impossible to get that much protein and calories without eating meat.

I do appreciate any thoughts on this!!!"

My ultimate goal is to get lean and use weights to help define my chest and arms.  Not looking to bulk up. I also don’t care about doing lower body because I already have muscular legs and they are getting their exercise from cardio. So I don’t need lunges or anything back breaking in there. 

The equipment I have at home is a bench which can recline, and dumbbells from 10-90. 

I don’t know where to start, I don’t know reps and weights and when to increase them for what I’m looking to do.

I hate exercising.

I had one of those dads growing up who was like “All well rounded kids must play sports”, and he made me play lacrosse every year until I graduated high school. Every year I hated it. It was never fun. So as soon as I turned 18 and graduated, and never did anything athletic again. No running, no yoga- nothing. And, I was fine for many years. I was always a healthy weight, and I worked as a teacher so my job kept me on my feet and moving.

But then about a year and a half ago, I got pregnant with my first baby at 39. It was a complicated pregnancy and I ended up on bedrest for 3 months. Then, I decided to stay home with the baby so I stopped moving all day like I did when I was teaching, and I have put on 55lbs. I hate it. It makes me feel gross, and dieting alone isn’t working because my metabolism has completely fallen off a cliff now that I’m 40 and had a baby. 

I need to start working out. My husband and I already belong to a very nice gym, which I’ve never been to because the idea of running on a treadmill or lifting weights seems both boring and unpleasant. But, I went online and they have all these classes and the classes sound fun. Yoga and Tai-boxing and Pilates and barre and some weird Ab Bootcamp. I feel like a 30-60 min class where there’s music and variety and someone holds me accountable would be way more my speed than working out on an elliptical. So, I want to start going.

But, I’m really nervous. I know that probably sounds silly- but it’s very scary to me. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m out of shape. My body is going to look weird in workout clothes. I’m afraid other people will be judged, or the instructor will get impatient with me. I don’t know the right etiquette for the class, or what to bring. 

So, I thought I’d check in with Reddit to see if you guys could help me out. Will I be the only 40 year old postpartum out of shape mom there? What should I prepare my self for?

Then, I decided to stay home with the baby so I stopped moving all day like I did when I was teaching, and I have put on 55lbs. I hate it. It makes me feel gross, and dieting alone isn’t working because my metabolism has completely fallen off a cliff now that I’m 40 and had a baby. 

I need to start working out. My husband and I already belong to a very nice gym, which I’ve never been to because the idea of running on a treadmill or lifting weights seems both boring and unpleasant. But, I went online and they have all these classes and the classes sound fun. Yoga and Tai-boxing and Pilates and barre and some weird Ab Bootcamp. I feel like a 30-60 min class where there’s music and variety and someone holds me accountable would be way more my speed than working out on an elliptical. So, I want to start going.

But, I’m really nervous. I know that probably sounds silly- but it’s very scary to me. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m out of shape. My body is going to look weird in workout clothes. I’m afraid other people will be judged, or the instructor will get impatient with me. I don’t know the right etiquette for the class, or what to bring. 

So, I thought I’d check in with Reddit to see if you guys could help me out. Will I be the only 40 year old postpartum out of shape mom there? What should I prepare my self for? What are good classes to start with? Any advice would be appreciated"

This is my first time posting here, and I hope you could help me narrow down my choices.

I read through quite a few threads here and on /r/Biohackers and watched lots of YouTube reviews before posting. However, that only seems to have muddied the waters...  


I'm 38, active, with not a great diet. A couple of weeks ago, I decided it was time to get serious about health and fitness again. Now I'm considering a tracking device to help me dial things in.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my ideal use case:

* Tracking workout calories (currently using Carrot for food intake, and estimating workouts)
* Heart rate and HRV tracking
* Sleep and recovery tracking
* I would love to have the device last a few days before having to be recharged
* All day / night wearing (business meetings and gym)
* For working out. Strength-based lifting, spin bike, trail running and hiking
* Interfacing with Apple Health would be great, or at least an iOS app
* Activity reminder would be super helpful (to get up every hour for example)
* I remember coming across a stress (elevated heart rate) warning a well - that might be nice?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the options I'm looking at:

* Apple Watch 4 or 5
* Polar Vantage M
* Garmin Vivoactive 4
* Fitbit Versa 2

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any help, and I hope to pick one of these up on Friday.

Goals:
Lean out (loose 20 pounds)w/eating around 1600cal per day

Grow my booty,back,and arms

Gain more upper body strength

Excersizes I like: squats,deadlifts,hipthrusts,bench press.  Also I like to throw in other exercises while I'm recovering from the main lift.

Since there were no fast-approaching strongman events and several upcoming trail races I decided to be as un-optimum as possible and try to focus on both lifting and endurance running.  The below review of my experience training for both activities at the same time.  I'll try to be brief but if there are any questions feel free to ask.

**Background and Training History**

Stats: Male, ~190 lbs, 5;9"" 40+

I started lifting weights when I was ~7 years old with my dad, and got involved in endurance sports late in highschool.  I didn't compete at the college level but participated in numerous off-road races in my mid 20s (~1998-2005) including bi- and triathlons that involved XC mountain biking and open-water swimming.  By best finish was 2nd overall in a local 5K trail race and I was a fairly solid mid-pack competitor regionally. Back then I was ~150 Lbs and fairly lean.  After 7 years of a bodyweight / calistenics break I began weight training again in October 2017 and began competing as an amateur lightweight strongman the following year.  


**Current Day Competition schedule**

I had 3 trail races and 1 strongman contest planned over the past 6 months.  These were a 5K in late June, 10K in mid August, a strongman contest first weekend of October, and a 15K the following weekend. The 15K was ultimately canceled because I don't communicate effectively and my wife had planned for us to do something else that weekend - but I was honestly pretty beat up at that point anyway. 

I'll skip right to the numbers from the last 6 months for each discipline and then provide more information on what I did and how it went below.


**Endurance Results**

The times below are nothing spectacular, but considering I'm pretty hefty compared to an ideal weight for endurance and speed and only had ~3 months to train before my first race I'm pretty pleased with overall progress.

*5K trail race: [7th overall and 1st](http://imgur.com/WGmSco6) across all Men's Masters age brackets.

*10K trail race: 27th overall, top 50% finish despite dehydration and running off course in the wrong direction for a bit.

*5K Strava virtual road race:  ~7:30-7:40 pace on a course with some significant hills (23:37 finish).




**Endurance Training**

The majority of my run training was base building - i.e., progressively adding miles and gradually pushing the pace a bit.  You can see most of my weekly mileage [here](http://imgur.com/lDPOajb) where I started recording after buying a GPS watch in April.  The month before that I logged ~3 miles per week on Sundays as a conditioning workout.  My overall plan was 1 long run (trail or road) on Saturday for easy pace, and a moderate pace on the other days.  In addition to the base workouts I did at least one speed workout every other week where I did 3 miles or less at a ""hard"" effort.  I adopted dragging water with me at all times as staying hydrated seemed to help with both running and lifting recovery.  Although my finish times and placing above were not terribly impressive, I did manage to get back into a level of fitness where I was close to competitive at a local level.



**Strength Results** (all in lbs, mostly gym lifts during training except the frame DL)

*Deadlift: 610# frame (15"" pick); 405x4 axle 

*Yoke: 520 lbs x ~80 ft. max distance

*Overhead: 135x8 (12"" log) and 195x1 (barbell)

*CG Bench: 235x3

*Contest writeup from the USS Texas Strongest [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongman/comments/den1av/meet_report_uss_texas_strongest_mwm_198/)

**Strongman Training**

Generally I have 4-6 workouts a week with two of them being ""two-a-days""  on Tuesday/Thursday  and once a day on Sat/Sun., which works very well for me and my schedule.  

For the last few years I've been a big fan of using the 5/3/1 approach to lifting, but my fatigue was all over the place week to week when I first started endurance running and having a set training max with fixed percentages didn't seem like a sustainable idea. I'd been interested in running one of Brian Alsruhe's programs for a while and I settled on sticking to something similar to dark horse for the bulk of my 6 month block, where I followed the program almost exactly as is for about 8 weeks, then dropped the conditioning portion way back and used the general ideas of the program (eg, giant sets that include ""working up"" a variation ""max effort style"" followed by down sets at a percentage of top set; then speed work on a ""competition"" lift; followed by light accessories if I still felt up for it). When it came 6 weeks till contest, I went back to 531 to bring my strength back up quickly as best as I could. 


**Cross Training General Thoughts:**

Despite all odds, it turns out that if you eat to maintain or gain weight you don't magically end up loosing all of your muscle mass, all of your gains, and you don't get the common overuse injuries that a lot of people have when they start running 20 miles a week at a 1000 calorie deficit to loose weight.  

I initially bounced around the various intensity thresholds of strength and running workouts and settled into what seemed to work best for me, which was ""submaximal training"" for both sports and a strong 2-3 week taper of the opposite discipline when approaching a competitive event.  I eventually fell into a schedule of taking 3 runs and 3 lifting sessions a week (note that two of those lifting sessions were actually 2-a-days so 5 lifting workouts total). 

Using the Darkhorse template loosely to work up heavy sets ""to feel"" without having a number in mind for a new variation was invaluable to help regulate my intensity and keep motivation up. The only time my strength took a serious dive was the two runs where I ran out of water and had to finish a few miles seriously dehydrated.  This happened once on a 12 mile run, and once at a 10K race, and both times I went in the tank and felt incredibly fatigued for the next 10-14 days.  Knowing it was possible to take that big of a hit, I was extra careful leading up to my October Strongman contest and dropped down to 1 long run a week. I found that while I was seriously fatigued in different ways over the last 7 months, cutting back on either training aim for a few weeks would provide a huge boost for the other.",True,False,[],False,1,t5_2zswl,46494,public,,self,,,7 months of cross-training for strongman and running/endurance,0,1572732042.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/dqb5f6/7_months_of_crosstraining_for_strongman_and/,,,"7 months of cross-training for strongman and running/endurance About 7 months ago I discovered I could run a mile with no pain in my knee, which is the injury (from a skating accident) that sidelined me as a runner back in 2007.

Backstory - Ive always tried to be quite sporty and in general enjoy being active, but im by no means in the best shape, i weigh between 18-19 stone and im 6ft. In 2014 i had surgery to repair my right ACL, sucesfully surgery and no lingering issues with the knee. About 10 months after i began to experience discomfort in both my knees, and its gradually got worse. 


Im now at the stage where, walking up stairs hurts, sitting down with my legs at right angles for longer than 15 mins causes severe pain in my knees, i need to elongate my leg (not always possible, cars, cinema, trains etc) and squatting is a complete no go, my knees make squishing noises and clicking noises i do, playing sports rquires a considerable amount of warming up and im sore for multiple days after, I wake up and get out of bed and i ache as i walk to the bathroom. Its really begining to disrupt my life. I have to be concious of it every time I travel, if me and my girlfriend go for a walk i have to mention ""ill see how my legs go"", and its worse in the winter!.

What ive been doing - so ive seen a phsyio and he mentioned its tightness im my thighs, glutes, hamstrings etc and ive had multiple sports massages and the lady comments on the tightness. I always feel better after a massage for a week or so but it slowly creeps back.  I also do stretches at home, I have a foam roller, but admittedly dont get to it as often as id like. 

Has anyone had anything simular, or can anyone recommend any tips or suggestions on how I can change this? Sports massages are expensive and i feel like it makes it temporarily better, im not sure its fixing the issue, should i continue to do sport?, should i stop doing exercise, should i exercise more?! I feel lile 30 going on 75! 

Please dont comment on spelling and grammar etc, I hope you can see through it to my greater point.

Reading through the forums it seems a number of people would like to run PHUL or similar routines using 5/3/1 Variations/Progression for the main lifts.

I am trying to enhance/teach myself more excel spreadsheets and what better way to learn then creating sheets to benefit the community. 

This specific sheet is tailored to the PHUL routine, but realistically you can alter the exercises/sets/reps to whatever your preference on each primary lift and have it fit any routine using 5/3/1 progressions on the mains. 

\*Features:

\- Calculates your estimated 1 rep max based on Weight &amp; Reps achieved  
\- Calculates starting weights based on % of 1 RPM to use  
\- Customize percentages used for work sets of main lifts  
\- Customize percentages used for warm ups of main lifts  
\- Customize increase between cycles (default upper 5, lower 10 lbs)  
\- Under exercises change exercise names/set/rep scheme to your liking  
\- Set/Rep Scheme auto populates based on exercise choice   
\- Weights automatically round to whole numbers

\*Working On:

\- Ability to arrange days and have accessory exercises auto-populate. As stands right now you can change main lift and the values auto populate, but I cannot figure out the accessories to change depending on what main lift is selected. 

Comments, additions, and any other feedback is greatly appreciated.

I used to drink and smoke heavy in my teens, including drugs, to my mid twenties, but I no longer do any of them.

I can jog for approx. 500 metre, and then I start getting tired very quickly after that.

I have been jogging twice a week with my dog for 3 years now, and I still cannot jog any further than when I started!! 

My workout schedule is as follows:

Monday: Weights (Full Body Split) including an workouts.

Tuesday: Jogging, 3 Sets of 12 Burpees, 2 minutes of Skipping with a speed rope, and then 4 rounds on the heavy boxing bag for 2-5 minutes, each round increasing in time, by 1 minute increments. I do Kickboxing on the bag, so it's a full body workout. 90 Seconds rest.

Wednesday: Weights (Full Body Split) &amp; abs

Thursday: Same as Tuesday.

Friday: Weights (Full Body Split) &amp; abs

Saturday &amp; Sunday: Rest Days

NOTE:

I do a mix of compounds and isolation exercises on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Full Body Splits. 3 Sets. 90 Seconds Rest in between each set. 5-15 reps. 15 reps first set, 8-12 on the 2nd, and then approx. 5 heavy reps on the final set for strength gains.

My diet isn't very good. I know I don't get no where near enough vegetables or fruits (I'm on a budget, and they are expensive in my country) so I have V8 Juice (low sodium variety) and cheap multi vitamins to make up for my lack of nutrition in my diet. I do eat a Banana every day though, usually before my workouts.

My sleep is crap. It always has been since I was a kid. I usually don't go to bed until midnight on weekdays, and even later on weekends due to stress, and general sleep problems. I wake up at 7:30 am for work and I'm constantly waking up during the night so my sleep quality is bad.

Parts of me wants to hit the 160lb bottom limit of healthy just to see if i can.  Parts of me wants to stay right where i'm at.   But i dunno.  I keep hearing  - but not reading anything - saying that 170 for my height is just too thin, but i think my family has a very ""Klumps"" mentality to how they view weight and it just nags at me."

Working with a personal trainer (PT) for last five months. Seen great results. Mostly heavy circuit training/cardio with a bit of weight training. 

My PT left the company and I had to switch. I was extremely disappointed, he's my bro. We'll continue to work together on his own once he gets settled somewhere new. 

I tried out three different trainers but couldn't find someone I clicked with. Finally last night I got this guy who is an ex marine and who's focus is on weight training. His personality is interesting to.say the least but I like his methods. Does everything without machines and just uses free weights. At first I was unsure but after researching I think it's going to be good for me. 

Now I'll focus on weight training, do moderate circuit training/cardio and I'm hoping it will break the slow weight loss I've experienced the last month.

A whole slew of new challenges has been thrown into my world and I'm sure the vast majority of us can understand this to some extent. If you're going through this, you're not alone and you kick ass for trying to stay fit and healthy through physical strife.

I've been out of the game for a while because I have epilepsy and I've been waiting for my medication to be adjusted and to get my refill this month. Learning what I've learned here has helped me stay around my deficit but I eat at my maintenance intake when I can't cook for myself or do much of anything.

Having a chronic illness and keeping a healthy lifestyle is an incredibly difficult challenge, as many of you know. I just got my refill yesterday and realized just how much I am unable to do when not medicated properly. I literally become an invalid (and my seizure type isn't even the worst kind). Now, about 98% of the time I can function again. I've been at the ability to function at 10% for several months. I watched my husband ride his bike and get into shape within that time while my muscles started to go limp and flabby. That killed my motivation, as it would anyone. I miss being in shape, I miss working to be in better shape but today I get to start again!

I wish I could thank each doctor and researcher personally who has ever worked on epilepsy and seizure medications for each type of seizure known. I would not be here without my team of doctors or my medication.

Getting my medication refill allows me to do everything most people without a debilitating disease take for granted on a daily basis. I can finally work again, walk again, ride my bike, use the computer, sleep, play with the dogs, go for hikes, ride in the car at night, cook for myself, work out and make better cognitive decisions, read, walk up and down stairs, shower and so much more. Having seizures can take life away from you, literally (SUDEP is one of our biggest killers), and I am so thankful to everyone who's ever worked on chronic illnesses to try and find treatments and cures. Hopefully, one day, we'll have a cure for epilepsy. Until then, we power through like the warriors we are.

So here's to all of us who have to fight with our bodies to live a half-way normal life and rely on medication to have a sense of balance and motivation every day we get up to face what we have to.

I'm going for a bike ride today for the first time in 5 months and I bought healthy, easy food to prepare.

I guess this post is just to show that when things get hard, you can get back on track, even if at one point, or for a very long time, it felt impossible. AND to commend everyone who continues to push forward with a healthy lifestyle when your body is screaming at you that you can't do it.

I've been to the gym to do some low impact fasted cardio the last several mornings and I love it. This morning I found my old heart rate monitor and started looking into heart rate training zones just to see what's going on. While looking for information about target heart rate training I saw a graphic that said I should only go into the 70-80% zone twice a week. My workout this morning put me around 77% average over 35 minutes. Is this sustainable to do 7 days a week? I am really enjoying starting my day this way. Should I decrease my average? Also, I like doing the stair master every few days as well to get my heart going. Is this a problem to do regularly? I don't really feel like I am pushing my cardio particularly hard. I feel pretty comfortable, but don't want to do anything that will force me off of creating a routine. Any thoughts?

I've been to the gym to do some low impact fasted cardio the last several mornings and I love it. This morning I found my old heart rate monitor and started looking into heart rate training zones just to see what's going on. While looking for information about target heart rate training I saw a graphic that said I should only go into the 70-80% zone twice a week. My workout this morning put me around 77% average over 35 minutes. Is this sustainable to do 7 days a week? I am really enjoying starting my day this way. Should I decrease my average? Also, I like doing the stair master every few days as well to get my heart going. Is this a problem to do regularly? I don't really feel like I am pushing my cardio particularly hard. I feel pretty comfortable, but don't want to do anything that will force me off of creating a routine. Any thoughts?

about 18 months ago i developed a back-pain that won't go away.  X-rays, MRI and physical therapy (i did it officially for 9 weeks, and unofficially off and on for a year on my own).   Doc's are guessing it's a compressed nerve or something and I'm getting an epidural shot this week on it.

I have a winged scapula from getting my bench up to 250 about this time.  I've been doing corrective exercises off/on for a year now and it's still not fixed but it is better and no more pain is coming from it.

Then i have a lower-left abdominal pain that went 10 months of being unable to be diagnosed, that developed immediately after a colonoscopy and while i was in the middle of physical therapy.  colonoscopy revealed diverticulitis a couple pouches that weren't inflamed or anything

- Primary had me try elimination diets, no effect
- urologist did ultrasound and hernia check - negative on both
- gastro did CT scan - came up with nothing
- gastro put me on 2 different anti-spasmatic drugs.  no effect
- tylenol, aleve, percocet all do nothing. (though that latter certainly feels good).
- blood work came up negative for anything concerning (like cancers).

Turns out it's a sports hernia in my lower left oblique muscle. So yay, that only took 10 months to figure out.   Discussing options about that soon with another doc.  No idea if i did this lifting (i wasn't lifting when i got it - just doing PT), picking up my kid, or if the colonoscopy somehow caused it.

And now - b/c i've been using lumbar pillows when i sit and lay down due to back pain, or b/c of what light lifting and jogging i've been doing these last 3 months, i've developed a left hip paint that i can't shake over the last month.   So i'm about to start the process of exploring how to take care of this.

But man, at 38, I feel like my body fucking hates me.

I've been going to the gym off/on for the past 8 years.  Usually a combination of lifting and jogging.    I've fallen on and off the wagon when it comes to my weight but with keto and IF, I finally feel like i have that under control.

But i feel like weights, cardio that's high impact, that all these things are just things I shouldn't be done any more.  Or if i do weights i avoid compound lifts.

I feel like i'm too young to be constantly fucking hurting myself like i have been.

And now - b/c i've been using lumbar pillows when i sit and lay down due to back pain, or b/c of what light lifting and jogging i've been doing these last 3 months, i've developed a left hip paint that i can't shake over the last month.   So i'm about to start the process of exploring how to take care of this.

But man, at 38, I feel like my body fucking hates me.

I've been going to the gym off/on for the past 8 years.  Usually a combination of lifting and jogging.    I've fallen on and off the wagon when it comes to my weight but with keto and IF, I finally feel like i have that under control.

But i feel like weights, cardio that's high impact, that all these things are just things I shouldn't be done any more.  Or if i do weights i avoid compound lifts.

I feel like i'm too young to be constantly fucking hurting myself like i have been.

Does anyone have a good workout plan that doesn't involve swimming?"

I am new to this subreddit but not new to lifting. I started my fitness journey about 10 years ago, but have managed to keep somewhat of a routine, just not anything serious for the past few years. 

I have been doing 5x5 maintenance for a while now. I finally have gotten motivated to try and up things a bit, curious what you guys think about this routine. I have limited days of the week, so my week only consists of 4 days straight, with 3 day rest between. Cleaning up diet has dropped my from 225 to 218 the past few weeks, so seeing results. Goal is to shred fat and drop some weight, but get strong while doing it.

Here is a routine I have been trying out the past couple of weeks. What do you all think?

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1

Back Squat, Bench, Barbell row, Dumbbell Curls

7 sets of: 12, 10, 8, 6, 8, 10, 12

For curls I do something a bit different.

Repeat 3x:

8x Preacher One-Arm Curls

8x Two-arm Full-supination Curls

8x Hammer Curls

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2 (Cardio)

15 min run

15 min bike

15 min row machine

15 min elliptical

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to this subreddit but not new to lifting. I started my fitness journey about 10 years ago, but have managed to keep somewhat of a routine, just not anything serious for the past few years. 

I have been doing 5x5 maintenance for a while now. I finally have gotten motivated to try and up things a bit, curious what you guys think about this routine. I have limited days of the week, so my week only consists of 4 days straight, with 3 day rest between. Cleaning up diet has dropped my from 225 to 218 the past few weeks, so seeing results. Goal is to shred fat and drop some weight, but get strong while doing it.

Here is a routine I have been trying out the past couple of weeks. What do you all think?

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1

Back Squat, Bench, Barbell row, Dumbbell Curls

7 sets of: 12, 10, 8, 6, 8, 10, 12

For curls I do something a bit different.

Repeat 3x:

8x Preacher One-Arm Curls

8x Two-arm Full-supination Curls

8x Hammer Curls

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2 (Cardio)

15 min run

15 min bike

15 min row machine

15 min elliptical

&amp;#x200B;

Day 3

Deadlift, Dumbbell flyes, Lat Cable Pull-downs, Dumbbell Tricep Extensions

 • 5'11, 205lbs. 

 • Strength training since mid 2016, strongman focus for most of that.

 • Diet: I work weird hours and it's hard to have a consistent diet. I eat a lot of PBJs.

 • open &lt;200s but got stuck with those fat 231's for this show due to classes being combined.

The Lifts

[Max Axle Zercher](https://vimeo.com/366058811)

 • 3 attempts for max. Previous PR was 335. Attempts went 295/335/355. So 20lb PR. Good for a tie at 4th. However u/tats-n-lats edged me out due to a higher opener. 

[Mouser block/Log press medley](https://vimeo.com/366063703)

 • 170 block/225 log amrap 75 sec. I Zeroed. So did 4 out of 7 in my class. I was pissed about this, I was super confident about the block because I got this lift *last year*. This cost me a ton of points and was a big reason I didn't podium. 

[""Mystery Event""](https://vimeo.com/366064763)

 • Mouser mystery event special, he announced during the rules meeting we would be doing a 700lb chain drag with these giant rusty chains he bought from an old coal mine that had shut down. Nothing in my life has ever destroyed my CNS like this. I got 32' earning me 2nd on this event. Only the class winner actually finished the 50' course. 

My legs turned to complete jelly, afterwards I could barely get up. I felt super overheated, threw up, and just felt like my body was shutting down. I ended up stripping down to my underwear, pouring cold water on my head and putting ice packs on my back. After about 20 minutes I felt normal minus most of my soul. 

[Max Distance Farmers Carry](https://vimeo.com/366064987)

 • 230/hand farmers turns at 50'. I had to get like 99' 1"" to edge u/tats-n-lats again(like I did last year). I honestly thought I was going to get just a few steps with how my body felt after that chain drag, but it moved surprisingly well. After the turn I stared at the cone for 100' and just went for it repeating cone cone cone over in my head. I started losing my grip around 75', I felt my left thumb keep hitting my leg, and I lost it 3' short of my goal. This gave me 4th. 

[Tug of War](https://vimeo.com/366059458) [tug of war round 2](https://vimeo.com/366066803)

 • Last years mystery event became a staple this year. This time it was single elimination bracket style. I won my opening round in a tough fight. I followed that up by slipping against the eventual event winner in round 2, however I know I had him beat. I could feel myself starting to drag him and lost my footing. Stupid mistakes. Round 3 I got annihilated by our class winner. (No vid of that, wasn't much to see anyway).

Results

 • I finished in 4th place out of 7.

Final Thoughts

 • Everyone was super cool and friendly, I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere!

 • there is no better community than strongman

 • Mouser puts on awesome show.

 • Stupid mistakes cost me a podium 

 • Excuses. Between my rotating shift schedule and a new baby this year, my training has been at best bon existent. I need to figure something out so that I don't regress again by next year. It's going to be tough but I've got to take control.

I focused heavily on form, and really more cardio then lifting heavy. 

Never felt like I injured anything in the gym, nor has the injured muscle group ever been even sore before.

But last Monday my non-dominate trapezius kinda ached where it connected to my mid back, my neck, and my shoulder. Not like a workout soreness, but like a joint aching when it’s damp, I’d also feel almost nauseated when it ached (very minor on the pain scale, like a 1-2 over all).

I still worked out on Monday, and nothing seemed to make the aches worse, but the next day it did seem as though using my nondominant hand to drive would cause a slight uptick in the ache (from I forgot about it, to a 1-2 with just a hint of nausea).

2 years ago I weighed 240-245.  I was in 38 pants.  XXL shirts started to look small on me.  The wedding ring I got to replace the wedding ring that no longer fit on my fat fingers, no longer fit on my fat finger. 

So I went on a high protien diet and didn't really count much of anything.  I ate less junk, less carbs, etc..  And I put on some muscle.  More than I ever have in My life.   I got down to 200 in a year, was benching 250, deadlifting 300, squatting 325.

I was jogging 1-2x a week to boot.   My folks railed at me the whome time ""you're doing too much of this"" (4-5 days a week, splitting muscle groups into different days.  I started with SS and moved to PHAT).  It enraged me. But I did hurt myself.  I pinched a nerve in my back, broke a rib when going low on a squat, and got a sports hernia in my oblique.  So I got a lot of I told you so's. And a lot of medical bills. 

I put on about 10-15lbs as I was backing off working out and getting my medical shit straight 

Since June i've been doing PT exercises, the exercise bike, stair master, and elliptical.. I've lost 40lbs since then and was asked by my parents what i was doing - and when the word ""keto"" and ""on/off again intemittent fasting"" came out of my mouth, they were ""so concerned"" because that diet is so dangerous and now i need to stop losing weight right now b/c i look too thin. (they were saying this at 180.  I'm now 175). I'm going to get ketoacidosis, i'm too thin and need to stop that diet, that diet is going to make you sick!

The reality is this:

* they never worried about the dangers of my weight when I was 240.  They only worried when I was 200 and more and more as I crept towards 175 (which is where I'm at now).
    *  Telling them that a healthy weight for a 6ft male is in between 160-183 blew their mind for some reason.    B/c when they were first ""concerned"" i was still very much in the overweight category and only recently out of the obese category.    
* Now.. I fit back in my 32"" pants that I had from the time I was 24 until I was 31, which i haven't been able to wear for 8 years.  Large shirts don't show off a belly or man tits anymore, my original wedding ring fits on my finger again.  But you know.. I'm ""underweight now"".  Somehow fitting back into clothes I wore all through my 20s makes me ""underweight"". What I underweight then?  How does that make sense? And i've been told by a sibling I look like a Holocaust victim (largely b/c my large clothes look weird on me now, but it still undermines all the work i've done)
* I started doing this for general health but b/c i have 2 chronic pains and I wanted to reduce inflammation of those pains.  (back and oblique) No one seems to give a shit about this.

But here's the kicker.

* My father is in the obese category (medically speaking).   He has high blood pressure.  He smokes, less than he used to but he still does. 5-6 a day. He's been smoking for 50+ years at this point 
     * I have a home video of my dad coaching little league basketball when I was 5 years old and he was my age that I am now.   He's very obviously skinnier there than I am now - he's about an inch shorter than me too.  But he's obviously in 29-30"" pants.  Somehow that's healthy THEN but it's not now? 
* My mother is disabled.  She has AVN which has required she get 2 hip and 2 shoulder replacements.  It's also in her knee which will eventually give out.  Due to the complexity of it in her knee she can't get that replaced.
* My mother is in the morbidly obese category of weight.  
* My mother has also been diagnosed with osteoporosis to boot.  She's had some falls that haven't broken anything but have caused even more pain around her joint replacements.    
     * So all her pain is amplified by her obesity, and her obesity is putting that much more strain on her replaced joints.  The ONLY thing she's really in control of is taking medication for the osteoporosis and getting the weight off, which she refuses to do.  My father doesn't seem to think this is an issue of concern either.  

They eat like shit.   They go out to eat 4-6 times a week.   My mother orders 8-12oz steaks, potatoes with extra butter, extra sour cream, big salads with extra ranch, she runs the waitress back and forth for ""more bread"" during the entire meal.   They both eat like children - lots of fried food, lots of ketchup on everything (even steak), french fries as a side for my dad almost as a rule. Sweet treats every night.  Ice cream, milkshakes, dozen donuts on weekend mornings. But I'm the one who needs a lecture? 

My mother has become angry, bitter, depressed (in the extreme) and VERY political and Fox News addicted.  She's contrarian about everything and has a chip on her shoulder about everything.

A nice, kind of upscale restaurant that was kinda of a cali, seafood, sushi kinda place - it had a lot of light fair to it, shut its doors recently and it made my mother oh so happy that 'frou frou' place shut down b/c what people ""need and want"" is comfort food!    She talks about with with the same passion, snark and chip as she would ""the squad's attacks on Trump"".    In a way - food has become this culture war thing to her.  Where all the lefties and pansies are off eating their veggies and light food while jazzercising or something.  and she's sucking down a extra large milkshake 

What's worse is it spills over to my kid.   He is not on a diet.  I just try to make sure he has less sugar in his life than i did growing up.

I got him interested in fruit smoothies with almond milk.  We make homemade lemonade rather than buy it at the store - and we'll use a stevia/sugar mix for it instead of pure sugar.  I'll use blueberry tea, and grape stevia drops to make ""kool aid"".   Pumpkin seeds,  snap pea snacks instead of chips,  candied pecans made with a sugar replacement, raisins, fruit., we make sure we have a veggie every night, and he gets a banana, apple or pineapple with his egg, pancake (almond flour), granola, oatmeal or cereal every morning.   We try to avoid artificial colors.  We try making a lot of stuff from scratch - baked beans, grean beans, mac n cheese - going as far as to reduce canned goods due to them being lined with BPA or BADGE.   We use reusable, stainless steal water bottles to avoid micro-plastics from bottled water.

But i still let him be a kid.  He gets junk food - milkshakes, candy, cookies, holiday sweets, trick or treat candy from Halloween.  But even with candy - we trying to make it better.  Stevia/sugar-alcohol based lollipops.  Stevia based gummy bears/worms/peach-rings.   Or even if it's just sugar - we at least try to ensure it's died with vegetable dye (like from beets or something) as opposed to artificial colors.

But parents act like i'm depriving him of his childhood b/c he likes La Croix and i don't want him touching soda.  They ignore the fact he's been to fast food places 10x more, at this point, than i ever did as a child.  He gets real milkshakes from 5 Guys.  He just had pizza, a cinnamon bun and fake-lemonade at Cicis last night b/c it was his b-day and he got to pick where we went to dinner.

So they think my ""diet"" is now affecting how i parent my kid in a negative light to boot. The sheer act of trying to be ""better"" some how is bad.

My wife has also lost 35lbs and no one has complimented her on it - so that's kinda shit too.

But yah - obesity, smoking (which i did for 15 years), all that slipped by without comment (well smoking did when i was young but never as an adult) but lose some fucking weight and try to ensure your kid is eating a more well balanced, less sugar heavy life?  I might as well say I'm suicidal.

people at work have had shitty comments.  my sibling.   I just don't talk about it anymore.   Everyone acts like i'm a threat to their fat ass for daring to get the weight off, exert the effort and then existing.

They snipped at me for years for going to the gym b/c ""you're going to hurt yourself"" and they're having a lot of fun with ""i told you so's"" b/c i pinched a nerve in my back and endd up wit ha sports hernia in my oblique.

I do not have muscle soreness. I drink between 3 and 5 liters of water a day. 

I am trying to get down to about 170 pounds at my doctors recommendation.

I talked to a nutritionist and she also put me at 1200, but she gave me the impression she didn't believe I was doing everything listed above.

So we all know that becoming a parent makes fitness harder: you have less time, less sleep, and more responsibilities. But it's ok that your priorities change when you become a father or mother! You are in a new stage of life. I knew that things would get harder, and I had made amends with the knowledge that I'd have less time and more responsibility with a little one. But I still want to be fit, and I don't want to stop my fitness journey. I felt pretty good about it.

But then I was surprised to learn that men's bodies undergo some pretty serious hormonal changes when they become fathers. For one, their **testosterone drops by about 30% and stays that low, forever** (I can link the studies in the comments, if anyone's interested... it's a well-documented phenomenon that happens even when controlling for factors like stress, sleep, and age). Testosterone is well known to affect your ability to put on and maintain lean mass and that drops in it also see a rise in fat mass and decreases in strength (not to mention lower libidos, energy). So now I'm worried!

Is the deck stacked against fathers? I wondered how many of you experienced this. Did you *notice* these changes? Am I over-blowing it?
